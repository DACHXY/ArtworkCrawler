Employing image platforms including Instagram, YouTube, Facebook and Tumblr as both source and tool Orupabo engages in the simultaneously monolithic and splintered abundance of images that define race and gender. In their wiki-generated content and labile fluidity these platforms both reinforce and disrupt established norms.</p>\n<p>Although self-taught and working otherwise as a social worker in Oslo, Orupabo has for many years created digital collages which she cuts and manipulates, using photographs from personal archives and found images. This combination of sources connects her personal history to a collective story, the private and political, in a matrix of appropriated images.</p>\n",

He initially mocks up many of his canvases using virtual reality modeling software (an update from Photoshop, which he used earlier in his career) and 3D prints many of his sculptures in bronze and plastic. Lee then recreates a distinctly digital aesthetic with airbrush and paintbrush. Working at small and large scales, the artist saturates his work with glowing, electric hues. Humans, animals, and hybrid creatures are frequent motifs, and Lee understands his compositions and hand-painted structures as animated representations of his own feelings. He studied at the Tyler School of Art in Philadelphia before receiving his MFA from Yale in 2013. Since then, he has exhibited in New York, Stockholm, London, Paris, Berlin, Beijing, Hong Kong, and Tokyo, among other cities.</p>\n"

The results are vivid, highly textured portraits and abstracted group scenes that come from unguarded, in-the-moment manifestations of his subconscious. Fractured faces and planes convey the artist’s often uneasy emotional terrain. In 2020, Matthieu completed the La Brea Studio Residency at The Cabin in Los Angeles. He has exhibited in Los Angeles, New York, Berlin, and London. Before committing to painting, Matthieu studied music and photography.</p>\n"

A distinguished professor of art at the University of Maryland, he received a Presidential Medal of Honor in the Humanities in 2000 and was awarded membership to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2018. Driskell studied under the acclaimed African American historian James A.

Working primarily in <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/painting\">painting</a> and <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/collage\">collage</a>, Driskell exhibited throughout the United States and abroad.</p>\n"

Wang has exhibited in New York City, London, and in several cities in China since receiving her MFA in 2020 from Pratt Institute. Her works include hints of <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/old-masters\">Old Master</a> paintings as well as references from <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/asian-art\">East Asian art</a> and combine images of Western foodstuffs with those of popular Asian snacks. This fusion of cultures results in a maximalist aesthetic that seems to reach for alleviation of diasporic longing through satiation of physical hunger. Informed by the bold graphics of advertisements, Wang often alludes to digital art-making by adding gridded patterns that signal Photoshop’s checkerboard background; she plays with the physicality of her materials. At times she adds thick daubs of paint to her canvases, which often take on unconventional shapes. Her works are in collections including the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/ica-miami\">Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami</a> and <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/x-museum\">X Museum</a> in Beijing.</p>\n"

For <em>Penelope</em> (2011), she took over an entire chapel and its courtyard with red carpet and yarn, leaving viewers to discern whether a loom in the apse is converting the chaotic tangles into the ordered textile, or vice versa. For her series “Half of the Speech on the Ground,” (2008-10), Blass altered musical instruments and rendered them silent: part performance and part sculpture (some of the pieces were fully realized by having musicians attempt to play them), these works aimed to explore the tension between construction and deconstruction, form and function. “The role of the artist is to provide some stimulation for new perspectives and reflection about the world,” she has said. “I think that it is to create a strange sensation, to create experiences other than day-to-day.”</p>\n"

Tawiah is known and revered for his unique approach of using nylon sponge for vibrant figurative representations. Adjei Tawiah lives and works in Accra, Ghana, where he is inspired by his community and surroundings. His unique technique, which he has labeled “Sponge Martial,” is a practice inspired by the cleansing of his mother’s corpse in the mortuary. Tawiah channels this idea of cleansing through his work, the bright, vibrant colors a representation of the bright moments that follow the darker times in life. Tawiah hopes that by developing his artistic voice, his work will serve as a source of inspiration to humanity through times of affliction.</p>\n"

Segun’s work exaggerates the feminine silhouette and is perhaps as much a commentary on the representation of women in an art historical context, (and the omission of black women therein) from the exaggerated proportions of the Venus of Willendorf or the multi-perspectival views of Picasso, who is an obvious inspiration to the young Lagos-based artist. More contemporary depictions of the African female form similarly adopt a deconstructed and vibrant view where the Black female form is a site for complex socio-political meaning. </p>\n<p>Segun’s work, however, is—at least for the time-being—slightly more internalized. There is an element of truth that many artists need to self-reflect before turning the lens outward. And while inspired by her personal experience, and her awareness of her mental and physical sense of self, Segun’s choice to focus on the individual becomes a reference point for a much larger schematic: transitions and phases in her life, including self-hate to self-acceptance, are undoubtedly issues that many women—African and otherwise—have experienced. There is a sense of a young artist and woman coming of age in these works—they are simultaneously vibrant but also codified, obscured, and protected. These works serve almost as a visual diary of how the young painter continues to define and redefine herself in a larger context. Segun describes her practice as a way of challenging reality and pushing herself to create alternative ways to position herself in contemporary art and society.</p>\n"

Magadlela studied at the University of Johannesburg and Rijksakademie, Amsterdam. Since winning the FNB Art Prize in 2015, she has shown at the 2016 Armory Show and exhibited around the world. Her work was included in the acclaimed group show “Blue Black,” curated by artist <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/glenn-ligon/works-for-sale\">Glenn Ligon</a> at the Pulitzer Arts Foundation in St. Louis. Magadlela cuts, stitches, and folds her materials across wooden frames to create multilayered abstract compositions. Drawing from her experiences as a Black woman and a mother as well as from Black South African history, Magadlela’s works serve as vibrant celebrations of Black womanhood while simultaneously suggesting the implicit eroticization of and violence against the Black body.</p>\n"

Sunflowers in deep yellow and orange float gently around the subject, while green accents provide the barest suggestion of the flowers’ leaves and stems. Hall founded his own design studio in 2015, and has since worked on commissions ranging from interior design and <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/related-to-fashion\">fashion campaigns</a> to <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/murals-and-wall-drawings\">murals</a> and illustrations. In 2019, Hall released his first book, titled <em>Greco Disco: The Art &amp; Design of Luke Edward Hall</em>, which showcased some of the artist’s favorite works to date.</p>\n"

While her source material is deeply personal, McCoy renders her subjects without faces, inviting her viewers to project themselves and their own relatives into her scenes. The artist has exhibited in San Francisco, Minneapolis, Denver, and Brussels. She has also collaborated with the fashion line Kith on a line of apparel and created “I Voted” stickers with <em>New York</em> magazine in 2020. As she depicts subjects from many stages of life and employs a wide range of skin tones and compositional styles, McCoy thematizes the diversity and complexity of Black families and experience.</p>\n"
