Dalí’s fantastical prints, paintings, sculptures, films, and writing helped cement the movement’s identity. Working off psychoanalytic ideas, Dalí rendered fantastical creatures and landscapes that could unsettle and awe. His 1931 canvas <em>The Persistence of Memory</em> is one of the most recognizable artworks of all time. Dalí exhibited widely in his lifetime, and his works belong in the collections of institutions including the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/tate\">Tate</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/museum-of-modern-art\">Museum of Modern Art</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artic\">Art Institute of Chicago</a>, among others.

Saint Phalle is perhaps best known for her “Shooting Paintings”—canvases she made by firing a rifle at paint-filled balloons—and her sculptures of extravagant, voluptuous feminine forms, which she dubbed “Nanas.” Her practice included books, prints, films, theater sets, clothing, jewelry, and even perfume. Saint Phalle was also celebrated for her large-scale public works and architectural activations, which can be found around the world. Her most famous, perhaps, is the <em>Tarot Garden</em> sculpture park in the Tuscan countryside. Saint Phalle’s work belongs in the collections of the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/centre-pompidou\">Centre Pompidou</a>, the Museum Ludwig, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/stedelijk-museum-amsterdam\">Stedelijk Museum</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/tate\">Tate</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/the-metropolitan-museum-of-art\">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/whitney-museum-of-american-art-1\">Whitney Museum of American Art</a>, among others.

The self-taught artist blends craftsmanship and pop culture as he stacks and glues together carefully selected decks, then hand-cuts, carves, paints, and polishes them to a smooth finish. Because of the layering involved, the finished sculptures—which take the shape of animals, body parts, skulls, teddy bears, and cartoonish figures—have striped exteriors. Intricate and precise, they can evoke <em>inami</em>, a Japanese wood-carving tradition, and the sleek forms of <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/jeff-koons\">Jeff Koons</a>. Haroshi has also transformed skateboards into large-scale collages and installations and produced sculptures in bronze, vinyl, and iron.

Though best known for designing the album cover for the Beatles’ <em>Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band</em>, he considers painting to be central to his oeuvre. While celebrity figures inform his work, folk art, fairground signs, and an overall sense of nostalgia also influence his style. In 1997, at the age of 65, Blake emotionally retired from painting, he said, and entered what he calls his late period. He continues to work but is no longer interested in the art world’s opinion of his art, instead creating what he wants regardless of its relation to his previous paintings.</p>\n"

        "text": "<p>Painter Abe Odedina draws inspiration from figurative and oral traditions of African art—and ancient Greek and Yoruba mythologies—to make his bold, stylized portraits and interior scenes. They also feature traces of magical realism. The artist most often works in acrylic paint on plywood; the resulting textures heighten his scenes of Black intimacy and off-kilter <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/contemporary-surrealistic\">surrealism</a>. Odedina initially worked as an architect. In 2007, he turned to artmaking on a trip to Brazil, where he was exposed to the country’s artistic traditions. Odedina has exhibited widely in the U.K. In 2013, he was included in the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/national-portrait-gallery\">National Portrait Gallery</a>’s BP Portrait Award exhibition. In 2017, the Underground Museum in Los Angeles won the Ellsworth Kelly Prize to mount an exhibition of his work. Odedina’s work belongs in the British Government Art Collection, the Tiroche DeLeon Collection, and the Jorge Pérez Collection.</p>\n"

The self-taught painter embraced graffiti before committing to a studio practice. He found a mentor and friend in <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/andy-warhol/works-for-sale\">Andy Warhol</a>, who helped the young artist navigate the 1980s New York art world. Across his oeuvre, Basquiat drew on his own Caribbean heritage; a convergence of African American, African, and Aztec cultural histories; classical themes; and pop cultural figures including athletes and musicians.

        "text": "<p>Anish Kapoor is known for elegant sculptures of spare geometries and organic forms, which he fabricates with feats of engineering. His most famous pieces have been public commissions, including <em>Cloud Gate</em> (2006), a reflective stainless steel sculpture in Chicago—popularly known as “The Bean”—and Orbit (2012), a looping structure of tubular steel constructed in honor of the 2012 Olympic Games in London. Convex and concave surfaces and mirrors, which offer optical illusions, are a common motif throughout his work. Kapoor’s fame skyrocketed in the 1990s: He represented Britain at the 1990 Venice Biennale, where he was awarded the Premio Duemila for best young artist. The following year, Kapoor won the Turner Prize. Today, his work belongs in the permanent collections of the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/carnegie-museum-of-art\">Carnegie Museum of Art</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/hirshhorn\">Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/museo-reina-sofia\">Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina </a><a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/museo-reina-sofia\">Sofía</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/tate\">Tate</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/moderna-museet\">Moderna Museet</a>, among other institutions.

Frink’s childhood was spent near an airbase in Suffolk, where she became a firsthand witness to the physical and mental damage that the Second World War wreaked on British soldiers. Her proximity to an airbase meant hearing frequent air raids and plane crashes—these experiences would later inform Frink’s practice, as she would go on to capture the poignant valor and vulnerability of man. At 22, she had her first solo show at the Beaux Arts Gallery in London, and the <a href=\"/tate\">Tate Gallery</a> purchased a work from the exhibition. She became widely known for her public commissions, particularly <em>Risen Christ</em> in Liverpool Cathedral, which was installed one week before her death in 1993. In 1969, she was made a Commander of the British Empire. She was made a Dame in 1982, and in 1992, Queen Elizabeth II made her a Companion of Honor.</p>\n"

        "text": "<p><em>Submitted by <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/plus-one-gallery-1\">PLUS-ONE Gallery</a>.</em></p>\n<p>Jenny Brosinski&#39;s minimalistic abstract paintings reflect an artistic language reminiscent of automatic writing, which is built up from individual stories on big canvases. The Berlin-based artist follows a reductivist approach to painting by restricting the creative gestures on canvas. Her paintings directly engage the viewer with the concept of deconstruction by demonstrating deftly uncoordinated compositions that “deliberately reveal traces of use, whereby the nature of their materiality is brought to the foreground”, as the painter highlights herself.</p>\n<p>Minimal mark-making, apparent brushworks and spray-painted compositions make her artworks characterized by spontaneity in appearance, while maintaining their mindfully balanced components in an alluring visual expression. The artist aims to derive benefits from the materials she uses, such as linen and cotton. She exploits their textural qualities on canvas in order to reveal deeper and more emotional reactions from the viewers. Brosinski adopts an approach to painting that envelops together both intellectual and distinctively personal rules. At first glance, her paintings introduce new forms of communication between irregular lines, childish squiggles, colors looking like stains, abstract marks, or even famous cartoons. On top of that, this uncomfortable visual allegory suggests a sharp-witted, effective and energetic juxtaposition on canvas elaborating the artist&#39;s emphasis on materiality, raw arrangements, and simplistic shapes. In this respect, Brosinski creates a painting and then deconstructs and reconfigures it, eventually developing new possibilities based on the first creative arrangement.</p>\n"

He has pushed the limits of fine art and good taste with sculptures that comprise dead animals submerged in formaldehyde; innumerable spot paintings that appear mass-produced and can sell for millions of dollars; and the exuberantly tacky <em>For the Love of God</em> (2007), a human <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/collection/damien-hirst-skulls\">skull</a> studded with 8,601 diamonds.

        "text": "<p>Marc Chagall’s dreamlike compositions depict aspects of the artist’s personal and family histories, and those of Eastern European folklore at large. Flying figures, elements of Jewish tradition, peasant life, and animals are frequent motifs. Chagall’s practice—which spanned painting, printmaking, books, ceramics, and stained glass—was immensely influential in the development of 20th-century art: His supernatural subjects and emotional gestures bridged the work of earlier avant-garde movements such as <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/cubism\">Cubism</a>, <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/fauvism\">Fauvism</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/symbolism\">Symbolism</a> with later modernist styles such as <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/surrealism\">Surrealism</a>. Chagall’s career was disrupted by the World Wars, and while the artist moved between Russia, France, and the United States, he managed to exhibit widely during his lifetime both within the continent and in the U.S. His work belongs in the collections of the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/ngadc\">National Gallery of Art</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/museum-of-modern-art\">Museum of Modern Art</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/tate\">Tate</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/guggenheim\">Guggenheim Museum</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artic\">Art Institute of Chicago</a>. Chagall also produced stained-glass windows for Hadassah University Medical Center’s Abbell Synagogue in Jerusalem, the Saint-Étienne Cathedral in Metz, the United Nations building in New York City, and the St. Stephen church in Mainz, Germany.</p>\n"

Drawing on pinup pictures, Sorayama published the first book of his signature “Sexy Robot” series of chromium-plated figures in 1983. Decades later, these striking works have sold for more than $500,000. Sorayama started his career in advertising before freelancing in Hollywood, where he helped to produce visuals for sci-fi films. His <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/illustration\">illustrations</a> gained widespread attention in 1995, when <em>Penthouse</em> began featuring them in a monthly column. While Sorayama has enjoyed a particular cult status for his sensual cyborgs —who appear empowered rather than objectified —he has also received mainstream commercial attention. Sony enlisted him to produce the first designs for its robotic dog AIBO, which won the grand prize for Japan’s Good Design Award in 1999. Sorayama has also worked with fashion titans such as Thierry Mugler and Dior on projects that have extended his illustrations into the realm of <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/fashion-design-and-wearable-art\">wearables</a>, sculpture, and performance.</p>\n"

His spare, often irregularly shaped canvases offered a crucial departure from the gestural abstraction that dominated American painting in the middle of the 20th century. In his best-known paintings, such as <em>Colors for a Large Wall</em> (1951), Kelly eschewed brushy flourishes in favor of spare lines and geometries, flatly painted in vivid color. He envisioned fine art as a compliment to modern architecture. Since his first retrospective in 1973, at the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/museum-of-modern-art\">Museum of Modern Art</a>, Kelly has been the subject of a number of high-profile solo shows at institutions including the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/guggenheim\">Guggenheim</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/tate\">Tate</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/centrepompidou\">Centre Pompidou</a>.

Mining cheap stores, markets, and city streets, Batchelor accumulates mass-produced items, disused domestic objects, and scrap industrial materials—including lightboxes, neon tubing, and plastics—which he repurposes to create colorful, often luminous, structures and forms. “If I use colors to begin to dissolve forms, I also use forms to prevent colors becoming entirely detached from their everyday existence,” he has said. Batchelor is also a writer and has written extensively on color theories, including a book, <em>Chromophobia</em>, which argues that a fear of corruption or contamination through color pervades Western cultural and intellectual thought.  </p>\n"

Recent solo exhibitions of his work have been held at institutions such as the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/brooklyn-museum\">Brooklyn Museum</a>; the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth; the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts; the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/yuz-museum\">Yuz Museum</a>; <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/yorkshire-sculpture-park\">Yorkshire Sculpture Park</a>; and the Centro de Arte Contemporáneo de Málaga. He has also participated in exhibitions at major institutions such as the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/museum-of-contemporary-art-san-diego\">Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego</a>; the Newcomb Art Museum; the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/museum-of-contemporary-art-los-angeles/works-for-sale\">Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles</a>; and the Deste Art Foundation for Contemporary Art.</p>\n"

She recieved a scholarship from the Hungarian Academy of Rome and traveled to Italy from 1941 to 1946. In October 1948, she returned to Hungary, which had been overtaken by a Soviet-style authoritarian regime. Determined to leave and after seven failed attempts, Reigl successfully crossed the Iron Curtain in March 1950 and a few months later arrived to Paris. She currently lives and works in Marcoussis.<br>Her earliest Parisian works, indebted to the oneiric imagery of Surrealism, include photo-collages as well as paintings of monstrous figures and of vividly colored phantasmagorical scenes, as in They Have an Insatiable Thirst for Infinity (Ils ont soif insatiable de l&#39;infini, 1950). From 1952, Reigl started to experiment with gestural paint application that expanded on the Surrealist practice of automatic writing. By painting and scraping the canvas, she produced abstract works that featured elongated, Möbius strip–like biomorphic forms in glowing and often highly saturated colors.<br>Reigl’s works could be juxtapositioned with such star artists of the New York School like Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko or Clyfford Still.<br>Her paintings are part of such public collections as the Metropolitan Museum of New York, The MoMA – New York, The Guggenheim Museum of New York, The Tate Modern in London and The Centre Pompidou in Paris among many others.<br>Artworks of Judit Reigl are available at the Kálmán Makláry Fine Arts.</p>\n"

She has been the subject of major exhibitions at the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/museum-of-modern-art\">Museum of Modern Art</a>, <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/centrepompidou\">Centre Pompidou</a>, <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/tate\">Tate Modern</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/the-national-museum-of-modern-art-tokyo\">National Museum of Modern Art in Tokyo</a>. In 1993, Kusama represented Japan at the Venice Biennale. Today, her work regularly sells for seven figures on the secondary market. Throughout her disparate practice, Kusama has continued to explore her own obsessive-compulsive disorder, sexuality, freedom, and perception. In 1977, Kusama voluntarily checked herself into a psychiatric hospital in Tokyo, where she continues to live today. </p>\n"

His spare, often irregularly shaped canvases offered a crucial departure from the gestural abstraction that dominated American painting in the middle of the 20th century. In his best-known paintings, such as <em>Colors for a Large Wall</em> (1951), Kelly eschewed brushy flourishes in favor of spare lines and geometries, flatly painted in vivid color. He envisioned fine art as a compliment to modern architecture. Since his first retrospective in 1973, at the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/museum-of-modern-art\">Museum of Modern Art</a>, Kelly has been the subject of a number of high-profile solo shows at institutions including the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/guggenheim\">Guggenheim</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/tate\">Tate</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/centrepompidou\">Centre Pompidou</a>. During his lifetime, he also featured at Documenta on four occasions and exhibited twice in the U.S. pavilion at the Venice Biennale. At auction, Kelly’s pieces regularly sell for seven figures.</p>\n"

A successful designer at the mid-century furniture company Knoll, Bertoia famously designed their “Diamond chair”, a delicate and airy steel-framed chair introduced in 1952 and still sold today. He would later devote his artistic energy towards innovative sculpture, finding ways to bend and stretch metal so that when crossed with wind or touch, it would create different sounds. Many of Bertoia&#39;s “tonal sculptures” were commissioned for established institutions and as public art displays. He has also performed concerts with these pieces, even recording a series of albums known as “Sonambient” music. From a young age Bertoia was friends with other prominent designers such as Walter Gropius and Ray and Charles Eames, and he regularly designed jewelry for his friends.  </p>\n"

For his ongoing series of “Exposed Paintings”, Innes engages in a process of addition and subtraction, layering pigments onto the canvas, then removing the oil paint with washes of turpentine. This method, which he describes as “unpainting,” leaves only traces of the paint’s former color so that black oil paint erodes to reveal a deep violet or green, as in <a href=\"/artwork/callum-innes-exposed-painting-green-lake\"><em>Exposed Painting Green Lake</em></a> (2012). The artist’s process is evidenced through trickles of seeping paint, rivulets, and dark edges. Innes considers Barnett Newman to be a major influence on his work.</p>\n"

He has pushed the limits of fine art and good taste with sculptures that comprise dead animals submerged in formaldehyde; innumerable spot paintings that appear mass-produced and can sell for millions of dollars; and the exuberantly tacky <em>For the Love of God</em> (2007), a human <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/collection/damien-hirst-skulls\">skull</a> studded with 8,601 diamonds. Through his installations, sculptures, drawings, and paintings, Hirst explores themes including religion, mortality, and desire.

After the end of the First World War, Dufy applied his talents to porcelain, creating floral and animal designs for china manufacturer Théodore Haviland for over 30 years, work for which he was awarded a gold medal at the <em>Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs</em>. Inspired by life in Montmartre between the wars, Dufy created his iconic depictions of musicians and orchestras such as <em>Musical Fantasia</em> (1927). Also known for his later Parisian landscapes including <em>L’Il de la Cité</em> (ca.1953-55), which sold for <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/jean-dufy/auction-results\">£77, 500 at auction in 2021</a>, Dufy’s native Normandy provided backdrops for his depictions of the sea and ports in some of his finest works, as seen in <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artwork/jean-dufy-le-quai-videcoq-au-havre-circa\">La Quai Videcoq au Havre</a> (ca. 1938-40).</p>\n"

The artist populates his work with alternately adorable and sinister child characters, who run amok in flat backgrounds rendered with simple bold lines and solid hues. Nara explores imagination and the individual, and his more complex canvases consider the intersection of figure and ground. Nara received his MFA from Aichi Prefectural University of Fine Arts and Music and has exhibited in Tokyo, New York, Los Angeles, Hong Kong, and beyond. His work belongs to the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/sfmoma\">San Francisco Museum of Modern Art</a>, the Rubell Collection, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/museum-of-modern-art\">Museum of Modern Art</a>, the Long Museum, the Aomori Museum of Art, and many other collections.

While he took inspiration from African and pre-Columbian art, along with the work of his contemporaries such as <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/pablo-picasso\">Pablo Picasso</a> and <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/alberto-giacometti\">Alberto Giacometti</a>, Moore developed his own visual language using marble and bronze. Throughout his career, the artist carved the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/madonna-and-child\">Madonna and Child</a>, nuclear families, and single figures in repose. His style embraced hollows, crevices, and undulating, biomorphic shapes that all complicated the boundary between figuration and abstraction. The son of a Yorkshire coal miner, Moore enjoyed his first overseas retrospective at the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/the-museum-of-modern-art\">Museum of Modern Art</a> in 1946. He swiftly became an international sensation. In 1948, he represented Great Britain at the Venice Biennale and won the International Sculpture Prize. Today, Moore’s sculptures can be found in public parks and plazas worldwide and in the collections of the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/tate\">Tate</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/guggenheim-museum\">Guggenheim Museum</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/hammer-museum\">Hammer Museum</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/stedelijk-museum-amsterdam\">Stedelijk Museum</a>, and the Art Gallery of Ontario.

Bringing quotidian ritual into the realm of aesthetic experience and focusing on the fragility of objects and materials, Calzolari attempts to saturate the senses in order to reveal the nature of abstract thought and the essence of matter. In 1966-67, he produced his first multi-media performance piece, <em>Ιl filtro e benvenuto all’ angelo</em>, which incorporated audience participation, light, darkness, grass, and birds. Calzolari invited spectators to dress and undress, to move freely among the flying birds, and to lie on the grass. Anticipating contemporary social sculpture, Calzolari called this piece an “activation of space.”</p>\n"

In addition, his education at the Ecole Brassart in Tours afforded him the opportunity to study the drawings and paintings of old and new masters.</p>\n<p>He cites inspiration from artists like Rembrandt for showing us the soul of his sitters, Van Dyke for his elegance, Bonnard’s palette, Fuchs for the fantastic world he invented; all of which influence his style today.</p>\n<p>He has stated, “Art is something you cultivate; it is alive! My joy of painting is to listen to the piece and to have a discussion with it. Each one has its own personality”.</p>\n<p>Fressinier’s process for painting involves a bit of sketching, however; he takes greater pleasure in being alone in his studio, letting his paintings speak to him and watching them appear progressively and without force. He continues to be moved by the work of other artists, frequently visiting museums and galleries and art libraries to expand his imagination. He is passionate about painting, and also enjoys spending time with his two children, gardening, reading, and playing guitar. He credits his wife, Colette, with being his muse and considers his faith in God central to his being.</p>\n<p>Fressinier’s paintings have been exhibited and collected throughout the United States and internationally.</p>\n"

She finds, scans, edits, and prints vintage photographs, alters them with <a href=\"/gene/watercolor\">watercolor</a> and pencil, then mounts details from the images onto tiles before, finally, painting over them in oils. This layering of mediums mirrors the layers of abstract and figurative meaning in her works. “I have an interest in the never-ending quality of an image,” Greenfield-Sanders says. “I think of these paintings as being traced from one medium to the next, perhaps being translated.” Many of Greenfield-Sanders’ paintings depict post-war American ideals of family and leisure, such as her idyllic seaside and backyard pool scenes. Others, such as the Korean War parachute paintings in the series “Against the Fall” (2008), reveal a more explicit skepticism about America’s fabled innocence in the 1950s.</p>\n"

Since then, TANC’s work has expanded to include compositions of pure abstraction, characterized by strong contours and geometric forms. His techniques include automatic writing, dripping his pigments, and spray painting. TANC also creates electronic music, a practice that influences his visual works, particularly in his applications of rhythmic marks or vibrating lines.</p>\n"

He has pushed the limits of fine art and good taste with sculptures that comprise dead animals submerged in formaldehyde; innumerable spot paintings that appear mass-produced and can sell for millions of dollars; and the exuberantly tacky <em>For the Love of God</em> (2007), a human <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/collection/damien-hirst-skulls\">skull</a> studded with 8,601 diamonds. Through his installations, sculptures, drawings, and paintings, Hirst explores themes including religion, mortality, and desire.

Vitali began capturing panoramas of sun-soaked beaches in his native Italy in 1995, immortalizing their crowds, architecture, and natural beauty. He’s since widened his scope, shooting beachgoers in Turkey, Spain, and beyond. Vitali has exhibited in New York, London, Vienna, Tokyo, and Rome, among other cities, and his work has been acquired by the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/guggenheim-museum\">Guggenheim</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/museo-reina-sofia\">Museo Reina Sofía</a>, and the Elton John Collection. While Vitali’s photographs capture a hazy, Mediterranean beauty, they also consider leisure, voyeurism, and conformity.</p>\n"

He combined his flattened figures with intricate patterned dress and semi-abstract, fragmented blocks of color, giving mythological weight to his scenes. He’s most famous for his collages, which he composed from magazines, advertisements, textbooks, and more. Bearden, who graduated from New York University with a degree in education before studying drawing and painting at the Art Students League of New York, helped establish an infrastructure for Black arts in New York.

Trueman achieves his unique optical and textural effects by alternating between gestural painting and spray-painting. Working on unprimed canvas, he uses squeegees and brushes to apply gestural swatches of paint. He then tapes off layers of his canvases and sprays acrylic paint on them, noticing how it adheres to the canvas. Such techniques create hard-edged bands of untouched canvas that bring a sense of order to his otherwise expressionistic compositions.</p>\n"

He has pushed the limits of fine art and good taste with sculptures that comprise dead animals submerged in formaldehyde; innumerable spot paintings that appear mass-produced and can sell for millions of dollars; and the exuberantly tacky <em>For the Love of God</em> (2007), a human <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/collection/damien-hirst-skulls\">skull</a> studded with 8,601 diamonds. Through his installations, sculptures, drawings, and paintings, Hirst explores themes including religion, mortality, and desire. Since 1988, when the artist developed and curated “Freeze,” a groundbreaking exhibition of his work and that of his Goldsmiths College peers, he has been the subject of major shows at <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/tate\">Tate Modern</a> in London, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/ngadc\">National Gallery of Art</a> in Washington, D.C., and the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/rijksmuseum\">Rijksmuseum</a> in Amsterdam. In 2008, Hirst controversially staged “Beautiful Inside my Head Forever,” an auction in which he sold his work directly to the public and raked in around $200 million for himself. His individual works have sold for more than $10 million at auction.</p>\n"

In addition, his education at the Ecole Brassart in Tours afforded him the opportunity to study the drawings and paintings of old and new masters.</p>\n<p>He cites inspiration from artists like Rembrandt for showing us the soul of his sitters, Van Dyke for his elegance, Bonnard’s palette, Fuchs for the fantastic world he invented; all of which influence his style today.</p>\n<p>He has stated, “Art is something you cultivate; it is alive! My joy of painting is to listen to the piece and to have a discussion with it. Each one has its own personality”.</p>\n<p>Fressinier’s process for painting involves a bit of sketching, however; he takes greater pleasure in being alone in his studio, letting his paintings speak to him and watching them appear progressively and without force. He continues to be moved by the work of other artists, frequently visiting museums and galleries and art libraries to expand his imagination. He is passionate about painting, and also enjoys spending time with his two children, gardening, reading, and playing guitar. He credits his wife, Colette, with being his muse and considers his faith in God central to his being.</p>\n<p>Fressinier’s paintings have been exhibited and collected throughout the United States and internationally.</p>\n"

        "text": "<p>Ken Price subverted traditions of functional ceramics, making clay sculptures that undermined distinctions between craft and fine art. He experimented with biomorphic shapes, vibrant colors, and sleek finishes as he produced abstract, cartoon-inflected works that look alternately scatalogical, sexual, and proterozoic. Price, in fact, took inspiration from erotica, geology, and traditional Mexican pottery, and his sculptures at times bubble, curve, ooze, and crack. Rather than glazing his ceramics, Price applied numerous coats of acrylic, then sanded each piece to achieve glossy surfaces of variegated color; this practice situates him within the Finish Fetish movement, which included artists such as <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/larry-bell\">Larry Bell</a> and <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/john-mccracken\">John McCracken</a>. Today, Price is represented in the collections of the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/art-institute-of-chicago\">Art Institute of Chicago</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/the-metropolitan-museum-of-art\">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/victoria-and-albert-museum-v-and-a\">Victoria and Albert Museum</a>, and the National Gallery of Australia, among other institutions; on the secondary market, his sculptures have commanded six figures. Price also produced paintings and prints that depict flattened scenes of acid-hued domestic interiors and urban architecture.</p>\n"

To achieve this sense of weightlessness, Nares invented a special apparatus that enables her hang above the picture and paint from directly overhead, avoiding any drips or other “sign of gravity” which might result from painting onto an upright canvas. Nares likens her artistic routine to hitting a home run in baseball, sometimes achievable in one go but more often requiring multiple attempts to accomplish. Though her emphatic brushwork resembles that of certain <a href=\"/gene/abstract-expressionism\">Abstract Expressionists</a>, she sees her practice more as one of cycle and repetition as opposed to the relatively unconstrained mark making of the so-called “action painters.”</p>\n"

        "text": "<p>Inspired by the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/dada\">Dada</a> movement, Arman (born Armand Pierre Fernandez) created unconventional sculptures made from accumulated trash. In the mid–20th century, he began exhibiting random assortments of garbage displayed in glass boxes, which he dubbed “Poubelles” (“trash cans”). He also introduced his “Accumulations”—assemblages of multiple iterations of the same object, which ranged from toy cars and paint tubes to retainers and faucets. Arman often adopted destruction as a strategy for creation: He sliced, burned, and smashed objects such as bronze statues and musical instruments, then mounted fragments on canvas, encased them in plexiglass, or presented them alone. In the 1960s, he was associated with <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/nouveau-realisme\">Nouveau Réalisme</a>—a European movement founded in response to American <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/pop-art\">Pop art</a>—along with close friend and fellow artist <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/yves-klein\">Yves Klein</a>.

In addition, his education at the Ecole Brassart in Tours afforded him the opportunity to study the drawings and paintings of old and new masters.</p>\n<p>He cites inspiration from artists like Rembrandt for showing us the soul of his sitters, Van Dyke for his elegance, Bonnard’s palette, Fuchs for the fantastic world he invented; all of which influence his style today.</p>\n<p>He has stated, “Art is something you cultivate; it is alive! My joy of painting is to listen to the piece and to have a discussion with it. Each one has its own personality”.</p>\n<p>Fressinier’s process for painting involves a bit of sketching, however; he takes greater pleasure in being alone in his studio, letting his paintings speak to him and watching them appear progressively and without force. He continues to be moved by the work of other artists, frequently visiting museums and galleries and art libraries to expand his imagination. He is passionate about painting, and also enjoys spending time with his two children, gardening, reading, and playing guitar. He credits his wife, Colette, with being his muse and considers his faith in God central to his being.</p>\n<p>Fressinier’s paintings have been exhibited and collected throughout the United States and internationally.</p>\n"

Yanai has also produced a number of collaborations, including a line of tote bags for Artis, a towel for Hermès, and a collection for designer Scott Sternberg at the label Band of Outsiders.</p>\n"

Shortly afterward, he was invited to exhibit in the landmark 1960 “Situation” show in London alongside other seminal abstract artists. In 1967, he had his first solo show at <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/whitechapel-gallery\">Whitechapel Gallery</a>.

He has pushed the limits of fine art and good taste with sculptures that comprise dead animals submerged in formaldehyde; innumerable spot paintings that appear mass-produced and can sell for millions of dollars; and the exuberantly tacky <em>For the Love of God</em> (2007), a human <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/collection/damien-hirst-skulls\">skull</a> studded with 8,601 diamonds. Through his installations, sculptures, drawings, and paintings, Hirst explores themes including religion, mortality, and desire. Since 1988, when the artist developed and curated “Freeze,” a groundbreaking exhibition of his work and that of his Goldsmiths College peers, he has been the subject of major shows at <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/tate\">Tate Modern</a> in London, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/ngadc\">National Gallery of Art</a> in Washington, D.C., and the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/rijksmuseum\">Rijksmuseum</a> in Amsterdam. In 2008, Hirst controversially staged “Beautiful Inside my Head Forever,” an auction in which he sold his work directly to the public and raked in around $200 million for himself. His individual works have sold for more than $10 million at auction.</p>\n"

        "text": "<p>Inspired by the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/dada\">Dada</a> movement, Arman (born Armand Pierre Fernandez) created unconventional sculptures made from accumulated trash. In the mid–20th century, he began exhibiting random assortments of garbage displayed in glass boxes, which he dubbed “Poubelles” (“trash cans”). He also introduced his “Accumulations”—assemblages of multiple iterations of the same object, which ranged from toy cars and paint tubes to retainers and faucets. Arman often adopted destruction as a strategy for creation: He sliced, burned, and smashed objects such as bronze statues and musical instruments, then mounted fragments on canvas, encased them in plexiglass, or presented them alone. In the 1960s, he was associated with <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/nouveau-realisme\">Nouveau Réalisme</a>—a European movement founded in response to American <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/pop-art\">Pop art</a>—along with close friend and fellow artist <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/yves-klein\">Yves Klein</a>.

His childhood was spent between New York and London, which have given him an eclectic and diverse artistic background. He has embraced a new genre of bricolage art with an expressionist style and street energy. It is no surprise that he first dabbled as a graffiti artist. His works are unique and brilliantly chaotic with a playful and performative aspect. Society conflicts, such as the obsession with social media, fixation with celebrities and labels, and generational problems, including drug abuse and depression, are subjects that he approaches in a coded fashion. There are certainly obvious influences, from Picasso to Basquiat, and what we are witnessing is a genuine desire to create an expressive language of emotion and storytelling, which is laid bare on the canvas. </p>\n"

His work channels artists like Vincent van Gogh and Willem de Kooning in both its thick application of paint and distressed brushstrokes, resulting in dark, labored canvases. Born on January 7, 1955 in Pittsburgh, PA, he went on to study at the Tyler School of Art in Philadelphia before moving to New York in the late 1970s. There, he rose to prominence alongside other Neo-Expressionist artists like Julian Schnabel and Jean-Michel Basquiat. In 2008, HBO produced an Emmy Award-winning documentary on the artist, The Art of Failure: Chuck Connelly: Not for Sale. Today, his works can be found in the collections of the Brooklyn Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Portland Museum of Art in Maine, and the Tuscon Museum of Art, among others. Connelly lives and works in Philadelphia, PA. (Source: artnet)</p>\n"

        "text": "<p>The point of departure of Zachary Armstrong’s art comes from his own private sphere: his childhood, his family, the American culture, natural history books he encounters. Armstrong’s works seem to contain a coded message about the person who created them, something that becomes evident when a motif is repeated and extended throughout several paintings and series, like a mannerism or a stain that’s part of us. However, while making secret references to his personal universe, his works also evoke some larger context, such as the idea of the American countryside, folk art, and the tradition of American and European modernism, reaching a bigger set of references that points to the universal. On the formal level, one of the most particular aspects of Armstrong’s works is the use of encaustic technique, rendering them sometimes sculptural. Zachary Armstrong was born in1984 and he currently works and lives in Dayton, Ohio.</p>\n"

The artist is best known for his large-scale architectural installations, smaller structures inspired by organic forms, and monumental chandeliers that comprise dozens of curling glass arms which radiate from a central core. These works are united by an emphasis on light; color; asymmetrical, curvilinear shapes; and a captivating extraterrestrial quality. Chihuly employs an expansive interdisciplinary team that includes glassblowers, painting assistants, carpenters, and metal fabricators. His work belongs in the collections of the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/the-metropolitan-museum-of-art\">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/whitneymuseum\">Whitney Museum of American Art</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/victoria-and-albert-museum-v-and-a\">Victoria and Albert Museum</a>, and the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris, among other institutions. Chihuly has completed commissions for famous figures including Bill Gates and Bill Clinton. He has also produced paintings and works on paper.

Widely celebrated as the “Father of Art Deco,” Erté created glamorous illustrations that reflected a modern luxury and prosperity emphasized by clean lines and geometric patterns found in classical Greek pottery and Japanese woodblock prints. Born in Russia, Erté got his start as a costume designer in the workshop of famed Parisian couturier Paul Poiret, where he would dress dancers and film stars like Josephine Baker and Joan Crawford and design stage sets for Broadway productions and Hollywood films. Also a professional illustrator, Erté designed over 200 covers for <em>Harper’s Bazaar</em> magazine. His paintings and drawings are held in the collections of renowned institutions like the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Smithsonian Institution. Erté’s alias comes from the French pronunciation of his initials, R and T.</p>\n"

Using paints and charcoal, the artist layers facial fragments, crude lines, and text slogans, which altogether suggest personality and narrative.

Born and raised in Essex, Preston Paperboy studied architecture before turning to fine art. He’s exhibited in London, Hong Kong, Atlanta, and Miami, among other cities.

        "text": "<p>Bambi is the tag name for a female British graffiti artist from London. According to U.S. <em>Time Magazine</em>, “Bambi” is derived from the childhood family nickname “Bambino” and is a popular figure within the show business world. Known collectors of her work include Rihanna, Brad Pitt, Adele, Robbie Williams, and “Take That’s” Mark Owen. Bambi, also dubbed “The Female Banksy,” creates stenciled works which are frequently described as gritty and masculine in appearance even if she is exploring themes of feminism, popular and street culture, while using  incorporating spray painting techniques with unique mediums such as diamond dust and gold leaf. While her identity remains a well-kept secret, the artist has revealed that she had a prominent career in the music business as popular singer. —<em>Courtesy of Fine Art Auctions Miami</em></p>\n"

        "text": "<p>Born in Cognac, France in 1968 to scholarly portrait photographer parents with an affinity for aesthetics, it was fitting that modern figurative artist, François Fressinier, would develop a unique, enchanting style.</p>\n<p>His father’s admiration for the works of the Old Masters and his exposure to some of the world’s most historic places, along with France’s Gallo-Roman ruins and Gothic churches inclined François to explore and create figurative, symbolic artwork. In addition, his education at the Ecole Brassart in Tours afforded him the opportunity to study the drawings and paintings of old and new masters.</p>\n<p>He cites inspiration from artists like Rembrandt for showing us the soul of his sitters, Van Dyke for his elegance, Bonnard’s palette, Fuchs for the fantastic world he invented; all of which influence his style today.</p>\n<p>He has stated, “Art is something you cultivate; it is alive! My joy of painting is to listen to the piece and to have a discussion with it. Each one has its own personality”.</p>\n<p>Fressinier’s process for painting involves a bit of sketching, however; he takes greater pleasure in being alone in his studio, letting his paintings speak to him and watching them appear progressively and without force. He continues to be moved by the work of other artists, frequently visiting museums and galleries and art libraries to expand his imagination. He is passionate about painting, and also enjoys spending time with his two children, gardening, reading, and playing guitar. He credits his wife, Colette, with being his muse and considers his faith in God central to his being.</p>\n<p>Fressinier’s paintings have been exhibited and collected throughout the United States and internationally.</p>\n"

        "text": "<p>Nathan Slate Joseph explores the painterly possibilities of steel in a body of work that fuses visceral sculpture with a nuanced palette of inorganic pigments. Inspired by fellow New York-based artists <a href=\"/artist/carl-andre\">Carl Andre</a>, <a href=\"/artist/frank-stella\">Frank Stella</a>, and <a href=\"/artist/john-chamberlain\">John Chamberlain</a>, Joseph began to experiment with cast-off metal in the 1970s. His best-known works consist of squares of galvanized steel—cut from industrial scraps—which he coats in vibrant, saturated hues and then treats in acid. Whether patched together in painting-like compositions or soldered into bulbous three-dimensional forms, Joseph’s works are intended to change over time, with exposure to the elements patinating the metal and creating morphing patterns and shifts in color. For the artist, this signals an attempt to empower nature and bring it into dialogue with industrial processes—a strand of thinking that has linked him with Actual Art, a loose grouping of artists who aimed to “collaborate” with nature in their art-making.</p>\n"

Using paints and charcoal, the artist layers facial fragments, crude lines, and text slogans, which altogether suggest personality and narrative.

Born and raised in Essex, Preston Paperboy studied architecture before turning to fine art. He’s exhibited in London, Hong Kong, Atlanta, and Miami, among other cities. Through his work (which also includes sculpture), Preston Paperboy explores questions of love, loss, envy, and greed.</p>\n"

Despite the mocking tone and seemingly slapdash nature of much of his work, Flood also demonstrates mastery and technical prowess in his “lace paintings”, such as <em>Floral Event</em> (2009), which are beautifully and meticulously rendered.

In addition, his education at the Ecole Brassart in Tours afforded him the opportunity to study the drawings and paintings of old and new masters.</p>\n<p>He cites inspiration from artists like Rembrandt for showing us the soul of his sitters, Van Dyke for his elegance, Bonnard’s palette, Fuchs for the fantastic world he invented; all of which influence his style today.</p>\n<p>He has stated, “Art is something you cultivate; it is alive! My joy of painting is to listen to the piece and to have a discussion with it. Each one has its own personality”.</p>\n<p>Fressinier’s process for painting involves a bit of sketching, however; he takes greater pleasure in being alone in his studio, letting his paintings speak to him and watching them appear progressively and without force. He continues to be moved by the work of other artists, frequently visiting museums and galleries and art libraries to expand his imagination. He is passionate about painting, and also enjoys spending time with his two children, gardening, reading, and playing guitar. He credits his wife, Colette, with being his muse and considers his faith in God central to his being.</p>\n<p>Fressinier’s paintings have been exhibited and collected throughout the United States and internationally.</p>\n"

        "text": "<p>Massimo Vitali is famous for his large-format color photographs of beach scenes. Throughout the 1960s, he worked as a photojournalist for European magazines and agencies. In the early 1980s, losing faith in his medium’s ability to adequately capture reality, Vitali shifted to cinematography and worked on television and film. Eventually, he returned to using the still camera for the purpose of creative research. Vitali began capturing panoramas of sun-soaked beaches in his native Italy in 1995, immortalizing their crowds, architecture, and natural beauty. He’s since widened his scope, shooting beachgoers in Turkey, Spain, and beyond. Vitali has exhibited in New York, London, Vienna, Tokyo, and Rome, among other cities, and his work has been acquired by the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/guggenheim-museum\">Guggenheim</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/museo-reina-sofia\">Museo Reina Sofía</a>, and the Elton John Collection. While Vitali’s photographs capture a hazy, Mediterranean beauty, they also consider leisure, voyeurism, and conformity.</p>\n"

After emigrating to Mexico from Spain in 1949, Goeritz opened the Museo Experimental El Eco. The institution served as the embodiment of these principles, facilitating collaboration and expanding upon existing notions of patronage. Best known for large-scale, totemic sculptures like <em>Moses and Heads</em>, Goeritz worked in a style that prefigured <a href=\"/gene/minimalism\">Minimalism</a> by 10 years. With its elongated, angular, rising and falling form, Goeritz’s sculpture <em>La Serpiente de El Eco</em> (The Serpent of the Echo) best embodies his artistic style.</p>\n"

The sensual nature of the works stimulates basic human needs and desires that generate cravings and passion.” Like <a href=\"/artist/claes-oldenburg\">Claes Oldenberg</a>, Anton plays with scale, blowing up donuts, lollipops, boxes of chocolate, and banana splits into absurdly large, somewhat menacing proportions.

He has pushed the limits of fine art and good taste with sculptures that comprise dead animals submerged in formaldehyde; innumerable spot paintings that appear mass-produced and can sell for millions of dollars; and the exuberantly tacky <em>For the Love of God</em> (2007), a human <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/collection/damien-hirst-skulls\">skull</a> studded with 8,601 diamonds. Through his installations, sculptures, drawings, and paintings, Hirst explores themes including religion, mortality, and desire. Since 1988, when the artist developed and curated “Freeze,” a groundbreaking exhibition of his work and that of his Goldsmiths College peers, he has been the subject of major shows at <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/tate\">Tate Modern</a> in London, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/ngadc\">National Gallery of Art</a> in Washington, D.C., and the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/rijksmuseum\">Rijksmuseum</a> in Amsterdam. In 2008, Hirst controversially staged “Beautiful Inside my Head Forever,” an auction in which he sold his work directly to the public and raked in around $200 million for himself.

        "text": "<p>Mark Beard is an accomplished artist and set designer, best known for creating artworks under aliases like Bruce Sargeant, Hippolyte-Alexandre Michallon, and Brechtholdt Streeruwitz. Beard imbues his artistic alter egos with complex biographies and individual styles, a conceit that allows him to explore the styles of <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/german-expressionism\">German Expressionism</a>, <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/impressionism\">Impressionism</a>, Postmodernism, and other genres. His most recognized persona is that of Bruce Sargeant, a fictional 20th-century British painter whose homoerotic works celebrated an idolized male physique. Named after <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/john-singer-sargent/works-for-sale\">John Singer Sargent</a>, Beard’s character was created as a way to insert an explicitly queer agenda into the (predominantly heteronormative or closeted) art historical canon. At times his works are controversial, as in the case of his <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/jean-michel-basquiat/works-for-sale\">Basquiat-like</a> persona Peter Coulter, which has drawn criticism for its use of blackface. Beard’s paintings, prints, and sculptural works are included in the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/the-museum-of-modern-art\">MoMA</a> and <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/whitney-museum-of-american-art-1\">Whitney Museum</a> collections as well as at Harvard and <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/yale-university-art-gallery\">Yale</a> universities.</p>\n"

Welling has experimented with draperies, aluminum, dried pastry dough, and window screens throughout frames that hover between abstraction and figuration. He has embraced a variety of techniques and media, from Polaroids and gelatin silver prints to inkjet prints and photograms. In his beguiling series “Flowers” (2004–17), he dispensed with the camera altogether, using light and color filters to imprint images directly onto film. Welling has exhibited around the world and enjoyed solo shows at the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/art-institute-of-chicago\">Art Institute of Chicago</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/hammer-museum\">Hammer Museum</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/smak-museum-of-contemporary-art\">S.M.A.K.

Marini drew on the tradition of Etruscan and northern European sculpture, reinterpreting classical themes such as the female nude, the portrait bust, and the equestrian figure, which he combined with aspects of modernism—in particular exaggerated and elongated forms. Towards the end of his career Marini’s sometimes-monumental sculptures became increasingly abstracted.

Her subject matter can veer into the grotesque; liquid drips from a gold-toothed smile, for example, or glistening high heels splash around in metallic fluid. Minter often captures her subjects through panes of wet or steamed glass, commenting on the voyeuristic relationship between artist and muse.

In addition, his education at the Ecole Brassart in Tours afforded him the opportunity to study the drawings and paintings of old and new masters.</p>\n<p>He cites inspiration from artists like Rembrandt for showing us the soul of his sitters, Van Dyke for his elegance, Bonnard’s palette, Fuchs for the fantastic world he invented; all of which influence his style today.</p>\n<p>He has stated, “Art is something you cultivate; it is alive! My joy of painting is to listen to the piece and to have a discussion with it. Each one has its own personality”.</p>\n<p>Fressinier’s process for painting involves a bit of sketching, however; he takes greater pleasure in being alone in his studio, letting his paintings speak to him and watching them appear progressively and without force. He continues to be moved by the work of other artists, frequently visiting museums and galleries and art libraries to expand his imagination. He is passionate about painting, and also enjoys spending time with his two children, gardening, reading, and playing guitar. He credits his wife, Colette, with being his muse and considers his faith in God central to his being.</p>\n<p>Fressinier’s paintings have been exhibited and collected throughout the United States and internationally.</p>\n"

Born in Russia, Erté got his start as a costume designer in the workshop of famed Parisian couturier Paul Poiret, where he would dress dancers and film stars like Josephine Baker and Joan Crawford and design stage sets for Broadway productions and Hollywood films. Also a professional illustrator, Erté designed over 200 covers for <em>Harper’s Bazaar</em> magazine. His paintings and drawings are held in the collections of renowned institutions like the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Smithsonian Institution.

Gual applies thick strokes of <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/impasto\">impasto</a> onto her canvases with a spatula, creating highly <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/densely-textured-or-haptic-surface\">textured</a> renderings of skin, hair, and clothing. A graduate of the Florence Academy of Art, Gual aims to transform classical approaches to <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/anatomy\">anatomy</a>, composition, and <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/light-as-subject\">light</a> into her own style. Also a self-taught <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/photography\">photographer</a>, Gual often creates paintings <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/photographic-source\">from her own photographs</a>, exploring the relationship between the two disciplines. In <em><a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artwork/elena-gual-awakening\">Awakening</a></em> (2021), <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/group-portrait\">five women</a> are shown standing close together and leaning forward so that they are supported by the back of the person in front of them; they are dressed in grey and black with bright orange eyeshadow on their eyelids. The comportment of the figures is nearly identical with the exception of the central subject, who stares directly at the viewer while the other women’s eyes are closed shut.</p>\n"

His childhood was spent between New York and London, which have given him an eclectic and diverse artistic background. He has embraced a new genre of bricolage art with an expressionist style and street energy. It is no surprise that he first dabbled as a graffiti artist. His works are unique and brilliantly chaotic with a playful and performative aspect. Society conflicts, such as the obsession with social media, fixation with celebrities and labels, and generational problems, including drug abuse and depression, are subjects that he approaches in a coded fashion. There are certainly obvious influences, from Picasso to Basquiat, and what we are witnessing is a genuine desire to create an expressive language of emotion and storytelling, which is laid bare on the canvas. </p>\n"

Toledo was greatly influenced by European artistic traditions—particularly by <a href=\"/artist/jean-dubuffet\">Jean Dubuffet</a>, <a href=\"/artist/joan-miro\">Joan Miró</a>, <a href=\"/artist/paul-klee\">Paul Klee</a>, and <a href=\"/artist/francisco-de-goya\">Francisco Goya</a>—as well as folk art. His hybrid style is characterized by its exaggerated and fantastical forms, with an emphasis on geometry and texture. He has depicted subjects both observed from nature and borrowed from dreams. Toledo’s mentor, <a href=\"/artist/rufino-tamayo\">Rufino Tamayo</a>, credited him with the innovation of a new school of expression. </p>\n"

Bradford paints with a formal inventiveness and a shifting sense of figure and ground, giving narrative weight to her figures who may appear as heroes or lovers, families or couples, or isolated individuals. Her chromatic scenes, painted in many transparent layers of acrylic, transmit a light-filled quality and offer metaphorical possibilities for issues such as gender and universal humanity. Bradford is represented by Canada in New York and has had recent solo shows in Tokyo, Berlin, Milan, London and Paris. Her work is included in collections such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the Dallas Museum of Art, the Menil Collection, and the Nerman Museum of Contemporary Art among others.</p>\n"

[Architecture] has always interested me in its psychological possibilities,” he has explained. The structures and surroundings of his hometown of Los Angeles consistently serve as his subject matter, though his style of representation has varied. While his early works featured stylized interiors of homes, he gradually shifted his focus to the exteriors of homes and other buildings, which he deconstructed and recombined into roiling, semi-abstract forms in grandly scaled compositions. Appel now incorporates photographs—of animals, landscapes, and urban detritus—into his canvases. Barely visible behind a scrim of painted gestures and shapes, they hint at the things that are displaced as we build.</p>\n"

His <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/unsettling-1\">unsettling</a> and sometimes menacing figures are often depicted in impossible situations, as in <em><a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artwork/starsky-brines-mar-de-fondo\">Mar De Fondo</a></em> (2020), a <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/large-scale-painting\">large-scale painting</a> that depicts a man on a horse riding through a submarine <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/landscapes\">landscape</a> surrounded by fish.

        "text": "<p>Matthew F Fisher paints idealized scenes of nature that appear suspended in time, such as a perfectly uniform wave at its peak just before breaking. The meditative process through which he works is reflected in the calmness of his paintings. Fisher slowly and intentionally layers acrylic and ink onto the canvas, rendering objects with such dimension and volume that they appear sculptural against flat, gradient backgrounds. Inspired by childhood memories of spending time near the water and contemplating the vastness of the ocean, Fisher often paints seascapes featuring recurring motifs such as seagulls, crustaceans, and the rising and setting sun. These symbols are rearranged in each painting to create new compositions and narratives. </p>\n"

The artist, who has also worked in verse and performance, embraces activism throughout all her work—in particular, she looks to history in order to better understand the present. In the early 1990s, Weems rose to prominence with her beloved “Kitchen Table” series: intimate black-and-white photographs that undermine tropes of African American life and womanhood as they depict the artist seated at her kitchen table alone or alongside various other characters. Over the course of her career, Weems has received countless honors, including the Prix de Roma, the National Endowment of the Arts Fellowship, and the MacArthur “Genius Grant.” In 2014, she became the first Black woman to mount a retrospective at the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/guggenheim-museum\">Guggenheim</a>, and her work can be found in the permanent collections of the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/the-metropolitan-museum-of-art\">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>, <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/tate\">Tate Modern</a>, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. </p>\n"

Using primarily oil paint, watercolor, and—eventually—ink, Zao developed a unique style defined by contrasting colors, intense linework, and lyrical abstraction. Like traditional Chinese landscapes, Zao’s paintings function as fragments of larger scenes and possess a fluidity, transparency, and graceful luminosity that reflect the interior energies of the artist himself. Zao cited <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/paul-cezanne\">Paul Cézanne</a>, <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/henri-matisse\">Henri Matisse</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/pablo-picasso\">Pablo Picasso</a> as early influences.

Born and raised in Essex, Preston Paperboy studied architecture before turning to fine art. He’s exhibited in London, Hong Kong, Atlanta, and Miami, among other cities.

He has pushed the limits of fine art and good taste with sculptures that comprise dead animals submerged in formaldehyde; innumerable spot paintings that appear mass-produced and can sell for millions of dollars; and the exuberantly tacky <em>For the Love of God</em> (2007), a human <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/collection/damien-hirst-skulls\">skull</a> studded with 8,601 diamonds. Through his installations, sculptures, drawings, and paintings, Hirst explores themes including religion, mortality, and desire.

Signac is famous for his use of Divisionism (the central practice of Neo-Impressionism), a rigorous method invented in 1884 by his close friend Georges Seurat, in which colors are applied to the canvas separately in dots or dabs, blended later through the viewer’s own visual process—a technique Signac exploited to particularly radiant effect.

He drew widely from popular culture and everyday subject matter in his most famous works: his <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist-series/andy-warhol-campbells-soup-cans\">32 Campbell&#39;s soup cans</a>, <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist-series/andy-warhol-brillo-boxes\">Brillo pad box sculptures</a>, and portraits of <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist-series/andy-warhol-marilyn-monroe\">Marilyn Monroe</a> and Elizabeth Taylor, for example. Rejecting the dominant painting and sculpting modes of his day, Warhol embraced silk-screen printmaking to achieve his characteristic hard edges and flat areas of color.

Throughout his career, Pesce’s exuberant work has experimented with color and industrial materials like polyurethane foam, resin, and plastics. Recent projects have been inspired by natural forms, like a couch that looks like a mountain range and tables that call to mind bodies of water (complete with miniature beaches and islands). But perhaps his most radical innovation is the combination of social commentary and design. In his iconic UP 5 &amp; 6 sofa and ottoman from 1969, a curvaceous chair based on the female form with a ball and chain for an ottoman, the beautiful piece contains an embedded commentary on the oppression of women around the world.</p>\n"

        "text": "<p><a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/pop-art\">Pop artist</a> Roy Lichtenstein mined advertisements and comics to make groundbreaking paintings that brought American pop culture into the gallery space. He undermined the distinction between painting and printing as he made canvases that looked as though they’d come from a commercial press; using paint and stencils, he meticulously rendered flat, single-color benday dots by hand. Lichtenstein introduced his detached and deadpan style in 1961 when he painted <em>Look Mickey</em>, a picture of the cartoon mouse executed in primary colors. Five years later, he represented the United States at the Venice Biennale. By the 1970s, he’d already enjoyed major shows at the Pasadena Art Museum, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/stedelijk-museum\">Stedelijk Museum</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/guggenheim\">Guggenheim</a>.

Her installations—which have taken the form of billboards, projections, park benches, condom wrappers, and electronic signs—feature texts which range from enigmatic, koan-like phrases such as “Abuse of power comes as no surprise” to longer, more involved screeds. Her iconic “Inflammatory Essays” (1979–82), for example, meditate on violence, vulnerability, and tensions between the individual and the collective. Holzer’s work has also targeted consumerism and the language of advertising. The artist received her MFA in painting from the Rhode Island School of Design and has since exhibited in cities around the world, including London, New York, Los Angeles, Zürich, Hong Kong, and Berlin. She has presented at institutions including the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/guggenheim\">Guggenheim Museum</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/centrepompidou\">Centre Pompidou</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/museum-of-modern-art\">Museum of Modern Art</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/whitneymuseum\">Whitney Museum of American Art</a>, and the Neue Nationalgalerie.

The artist takes emblematic visuals from Western history, such as the moon landing of 1967, the <em>Mona Lisa</em>, and photographs of celebrities, and places them on acrylic mirrors. The viewer then sees his or her own image reflected through a visual idiom that belongs to humanity as a whole. Although the images embody a cultural language, the colorful text acts a universalizing agent, highlighting the significance of each image. </p>\n"

He represented Israel in the 1978 Venice Biennale, where he stood in the middle of a room of live sheep tinting their fleece blue, referencing his work as a shepherd on a kibbutz. Poetically merging man and nature, the industrial and the organic, and painting and sculpture in his works, he produces painterly sculptures and sculptural paintings full of powerful emotion.</p>\n"

        "text": "<p>Born in Cognac, France in 1968 to scholarly portrait photographer parents with an affinity for aesthetics, it was fitting that modern figurative artist, François Fressinier, would develop a unique, enchanting style.</p>\n<p>His father’s admiration for the works of the Old Masters and his exposure to some of the world’s most historic places, along with France’s Gallo-Roman ruins and Gothic churches inclined François to explore and create figurative, symbolic artwork. In addition, his education at the Ecole Brassart in Tours afforded him the opportunity to study the drawings and paintings of old and new masters.</p>\n<p>He cites inspiration from artists like Rembrandt for showing us the soul of his sitters, Van Dyke for his elegance, Bonnard’s palette, Fuchs for the fantastic world he invented; all of which influence his style today.</p>\n<p>He has stated, “Art is something you cultivate; it is alive! My joy of painting is to listen to the piece and to have a discussion with it. Each one has its own personality”.</p>\n<p>Fressinier’s process for painting involves a bit of sketching, however; he takes greater pleasure in being alone in his studio, letting his paintings speak to him and watching them appear progressively and without force. He continues to be moved by the work of other artists, frequently visiting museums and galleries and art libraries to expand his imagination. He is passionate about painting, and also enjoys spending time with his two children, gardening, reading, and playing guitar. He credits his wife, Colette, with being his muse and considers his faith in God central to his being.</p>\n<p>Fressinier’s paintings have been exhibited and collected throughout the United States and internationally.</p>\n"

Rather than constructing her still lifes from flowers, fruit, and elements of the natural world, Dunbar prefers consumer products, which she positions within the context of human industry. “I consider myself a fairly ordinary person, so perhaps I can relate more to a bottle of ketchup than I can to a vase of flowers,” she says. For example, in <em>Clean</em> (2011), she paints dishes that have been placed in a dishwasher by an implied though invisible human hand. Her urban landscapes also feature a human presence, often including men working on construction sites or with mechanical objects such as Legos, bicycles, and engines.</p>\n"

Although critics have suggested that Baechler’s work, reminiscent of <a href=\"/artist/jean-dubuffet\">Jean Dubuffet</a>, is a critique of innocence and sincerity, Baechler sees himself as an abstract artist whose concerns are primarily formal, rooted in line, shape, color, and composition. A 2011 solo exhibition included bronze sculptures based on childlike silhouettes of flowers as well as numerous faux-naïf black-and-white flower paintings. Baechler is often associated with other <a href=\"/gene/east-village-art\">East Village</a> artists, including <a href=\"/artist/keith-haring\">Keith Haring</a>, <a href=\"/artist/jean-michel-basquiat\">Jean-Michel Basquiat</a>, and <a href=\"/artist/kenny-scharf\">Kenny Scharf</a>.</p>\n"

She finds, scans, edits, and prints vintage photographs, alters them with <a href=\"/gene/watercolor\">watercolor</a> and pencil, then mounts details from the images onto tiles before, finally, painting over them in oils. This layering of mediums mirrors the layers of abstract and figurative meaning in her works. “I have an interest in the never-ending quality of an image,” Greenfield-Sanders says. “I think of these paintings as being traced from one medium to the next, perhaps being translated.” Many of Greenfield-Sanders’ paintings depict post-war American ideals of family and leisure, such as her idyllic seaside and backyard pool scenes. Others, such as the Korean War parachute paintings in the series “Against the Fall” (2008), reveal a more explicit skepticism about America’s fabled innocence in the 1950s.</p>\n"

He has pushed the limits of fine art and good taste with sculptures that comprise dead animals submerged in formaldehyde; innumerable spot paintings that appear mass-produced and can sell for millions of dollars; and the exuberantly tacky <em>For the Love of God</em> (2007), a human <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/collection/damien-hirst-skulls\">skull</a> studded with 8,601 diamonds. Through his installations, sculptures, drawings, and paintings, Hirst explores themes including religion, mortality, and desire. Since 1988, when the artist developed and curated “Freeze,” a groundbreaking exhibition of his work and that of his Goldsmiths College peers, he has been the subject of major shows at <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/tate\">Tate Modern</a> in London, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/ngadc\">National Gallery of Art</a> in Washington, D.C., and the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/rijksmuseum\">Rijksmuseum</a> in Amsterdam. In 2008, Hirst controversially staged “Beautiful Inside my Head Forever,” an auction in which he sold his work directly to the public and raked in around $200 million for himself. His individual works have sold for more than $10 million at auction.</p>\n"

The spare designs, which the artist partially based on Japanese kanji, appeared in doorways and on sides of buildings while the artist was living in homeless shelters and social housing. In the years since, Stik’s artmaking has expanded beyond his native London streets and into gallery spaces across the city. Works from his studio practice—which includes painting, sculpture, and editioned prints—have fetched six-figure prices on the secondary market. Though his signature iconography is <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/contemporary-minimalist\">minimalist</a> in execution, Stik maintains a commitment to social justice both inside and outside his studio. His 2014 mural <em>Little Big Mother</em> calls attention to the need for social housing, while proceeds from an auction for <em>Holding Hands (Maquette)</em> (2020) helped fund an outdoor sculpture program in Hackney.</p>\n"

        "text": "<p>Harry Bertoia’s oeuvre encompasses sound sculptures, furniture, and jewelry design. A successful designer at the mid-century furniture company Knoll, Bertoia famously designed their “Diamond chair”, a delicate and airy steel-framed chair introduced in 1952 and still sold today. He would later devote his artistic energy towards innovative sculpture, finding ways to bend and stretch metal so that when crossed with wind or touch, it would create different sounds. Many of Bertoia&#39;s “tonal sculptures” were commissioned for established institutions and as public art displays. He has also performed concerts with these pieces, even recording a series of albums known as “Sonambient” music. From a young age Bertoia was friends with other prominent designers such as Walter Gropius and Ray and Charles Eames, and he regularly designed jewelry for his friends.  </p>\n"

He rejected the principles of <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/abstract-expressionism\">Abstract Expressionism</a> and made bold paintings and inventive sculptures—both cut-metal works and assemblages—which riff on pop culture and art historical compositions. Women were a constant source of inspiration: Wesselmann’s most famous series, “<a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist-series/tom-wesselmann-great-american-nude\">Great American Nude</a>” (1961–73), channels the brazen energy of American advertising and features flat, faceless female figures whom the artist often situated among stars and stripes. Educated at Cooper Union and the Art Academy of Cincinnati, Wesselmann got his start selling cartoons to magazines, newspapers, and ad agencies before he found success as a fine artist.

His colorful, cartoonish characters—always rendered in profile, with one bold eye looking out at the viewer—lent a vibrant, human element to the stark symbol of division. Today, segments of Noir’s Berlin Wall murals belong to art collections around the world. The French-born, Berlin-based artist has expanded his practice to include painting, printmaking, and public art. Noir has exhibited in London (where he often collaborates with local graffiti artist <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/stik\">Stik</a>), Los Angeles, and Berlin. He has worked with brands including Hennessey and turntable manufacturer Rega on limited-edition products that are designed in his signature style. After decades, vivacity and simplicity remain Noir’s lucrative calling cards. </p>\n"

        "text": "<p>Since coming to prominence in the late 1990s, Yang Shaobin has been producing paintings, installations, and videos crowded with haunting human figures, expressive of his deep concern with the effects of political, social, and economic forces on an individual’s life. In his early, monochromatic works, Yang embodied the emotional turmoil caused by social upheaval, and the anxiety provoked by the mores of contemporary society, in images of distorted, anguished figures. Politics and current events imbue his later works, in which he intersperses portraits of various world leaders with images from the news and forceful abstract passages. Exploring his experience growing up in a family of coal miners for his most recent works, Yang depicts soot-covered miners who seem to meld with their surroundings, suggestive of the disturbing invisibility of these individuals who labor dangerously underground.</p>\n"

        "text": "<p>Born in Adelaide, Australia, Hayley Lever was known for his town-shore landscapes and still-life painting in a style that combined impressionism with vivid colors and strong lines of realism---post impressionism. In his use of color, he was deeply influenced by Vincent Van Gogh. He freely explored numerous styles based on impressionism but was never locked into any particular style. </p>\n<p>He showed early art talent and traveled to England in 1893. He studied art in London and then painted at an artists&#39; colony in Cornwall on the seacoast of St. Ives where he began his seacoast paintings. He received much attention in Europe for these works. In 1908, he did a series of paintings called &quot;Van Gogh&#39;s Hospital, Holland&quot; expressing the profound influence he felt of that artist.</p>\n<p>Lever came to America in 1911, encouraged by American artist Ernest Lawson whom he knew in France, and was soon counted among the most widely exhibited artists in New York City. Many of his scenes were of Manhattan. He had a summer studio in Gloucester, Massachusetts and from 1919 to 1931 taught at the Art Students League in New York City. He also became Director of the Studio Art Club in Mount Vernon, New York. </p>\n<p>Lever imparted to his students the following message: &quot;Art is the re-creation of mood in line, form and color. If I were confined to my own back yard for the rest of my life, I&#39;d still have more pictures in my mind than I would have time to paint. Art is nothing but having a good time&quot; (Comenos Fine Art).</p>\n<p>He died in Mount Vernon, New York in 1958, having suffered ill health the last few years of his life.</p>\n<p>He received many awards and critical acclaim and his works were purchased by major American museums, such as New York&#39;s Metropolitan Museum of Art and Washington&#39;s Phillips Collection and Corcoran Museum. </p>\n"

        "text": "<p>Inspired by the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/dada\">Dada</a> movement, Arman (born Armand Pierre Fernandez) created unconventional sculptures made from accumulated trash. In the mid–20th century, he began exhibiting random assortments of garbage displayed in glass boxes, which he dubbed “Poubelles” (“trash cans”). He also introduced his “Accumulations”—assemblages of multiple iterations of the same object, which ranged from toy cars and paint tubes to retainers and faucets. Arman often adopted destruction as a strategy for creation: He sliced, burned, and smashed objects such as bronze statues and musical instruments, then mounted fragments on canvas, encased them in plexiglass, or presented them alone. In the 1960s, he was associated with <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/nouveau-realisme\">Nouveau Réalisme</a>—a European movement founded in response to American <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/pop-art\">Pop art</a>—along with close friend and fellow artist <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/yves-klein\">Yves Klein</a>. Arman exhibited extensively throughout his lifetime and received numerous awards. His work has sold for six figures at auction and belongs in the collections of the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/the-museum-of-modern-art\">Museum of Modern Art</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/hirshhorn-museum-and-sculpture-garden\">Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/tate\">Tate</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/stedelijk-museum-amsterdam\">Stedelijk Museum</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/tel-aviv-museum-of-art\">Tel Aviv Museum of Art</a>, among other institutions.</p>\n"

She works by combining color, form, and pattern, both intuitively and intentionally, digging up sensations as intangible as the fist time she ever told a lie or the specific color of a beloved childhood bathing suit. “The paintings are like dreams,” Yazdan has said of her work. “The events of the day [are] reorganized and combined with other events and memories until a new, often surprising, reality has taken shape.”</p>\n"

His childhood was spent between New York and London, which have given him an eclectic and diverse artistic background. He has embraced a new genre of bricolage art with an expressionist style and street energy. It is no surprise that he first dabbled as a graffiti artist. His works are unique and brilliantly chaotic with a playful and performative aspect. Society conflicts, such as the obsession with social media, fixation with celebrities and labels, and generational problems, including drug abuse and depression, are subjects that he approaches in a coded fashion. There are certainly obvious influences, from Picasso to Basquiat, and what we are witnessing is a genuine desire to create an expressive language of emotion and storytelling, which is laid bare on the canvas. </p>\n"

In his signature works, HUSH superimposes layers of vibrant wheatpaste patterns and <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/graffiti-and-street-art\">graffiti</a> onto delicate stencils of women’s faces. His unique approach to <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/portrait\">portraiture</a> blends motifs from Eastern and Western art, resulting in abstracted works that appear both glamorous and seedy. HUSH studied graphic design at Newcastle University and worked as a toy designer in Japan, where he developed an appreciation for Japanese culture that continues to shape his work. HUSH’s art extends across a range of mediums, from outdoor <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/murals-and-wall-drawings\">murals</a> to <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/large-scale-painting\">large</a>- and <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/miniature-and-small-scale-paintings\">small-scale paintings</a>, <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/silkscreen-1\">screenprints</a>, and, most recently, NFTs. His works have been exhibited in galleries across Europe, the United States, and Australia.</p>\n"

Trueman achieves his unique optical and textural effects by alternating between gestural painting and spray-painting. Working on unprimed canvas, he uses squeegees and brushes to apply gestural swatches of paint. He then tapes off layers of his canvases and sprays acrylic paint on them, noticing how it adheres to the canvas. Such techniques create hard-edged bands of untouched canvas that bring a sense of order to his otherwise expressionistic compositions.</p>\n"

In this way, she approaches abstraction through sly and deliberate means. “The historical paintings I work from become structures on which to hang paint; the soundness of these structures capacitates great improvisational freedom. The real subject becomes the substance and surface of oil paint, the variety of its applications, and the ways in which it can be used to celebrate life,” she has said.</p>\n"

The institution served as the embodiment of these principles, facilitating collaboration and expanding upon existing notions of patronage. Best known for large-scale, totemic sculptures like <em>Moses and Heads</em>, Goeritz worked in a style that prefigured <a href=\"/gene/minimalism\">Minimalism</a> by 10 years.

He has pushed the limits of fine art and good taste with sculptures that comprise dead animals submerged in formaldehyde; innumerable spot paintings that appear mass-produced and can sell for millions of dollars; and the exuberantly tacky <em>For the Love of God</em> (2007), a human <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/collection/damien-hirst-skulls\">skull</a> studded with 8,601 diamonds. Through his installations, sculptures, drawings, and paintings, Hirst explores themes including religion, mortality, and desire. Since 1988, when the artist developed and curated “Freeze,” a groundbreaking exhibition of his work and that of his Goldsmiths College peers, he has been the subject of major shows at <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/tate\">Tate Modern</a> in London, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/ngadc\">National Gallery of Art</a> in Washington, D.C., and the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/rijksmuseum\">Rijksmuseum</a> in Amsterdam. In 2008, Hirst controversially staged “Beautiful Inside my Head Forever,” an auction in which he sold his work directly to the public and raked in around $200 million for himself. His individual works have sold for more than $10 million at auction.</p>\n"

The Brooklyn-based artist creates layered compositions based subject matter from her daily life: books, TV shows, dreams, and past experiences. She works by combining color, form, and pattern, both intuitively and intentionally, digging up sensations as intangible as the fist time she ever told a lie or the specific color of a beloved childhood bathing suit. “The paintings are like dreams,” Yazdan has said of her work. “The events of the day [are] reorganized and combined with other events and memories until a new, often surprising, reality has taken shape.”</p>\n"

Maar had an active and respected career as an avant-garde photographer and <a href=\"/gene/surrealism\">Surrealist</a> artist. A prominent member of the Parisian avant-garde, her friends and lovers included Georges Bataille, <a href=\"/artist/yves-tanguy\">Yves Tanguy</a>, <a href=\"/artist/henri-cartier-bresson\">Henri Cartier-Bresson</a>, and André Breton. Maar had originally studied painting but turned to photography after modeling for <a href=\"/artist/man-ray\">Man Ray</a>’s photographs. She produced portraits, nudes, landscapes, fashion photographs, and <a href=\"/gene/photomontage\">photomontages</a>. Her montages frequently featured strong architectural elements and narratives. Among Surrealist circles, she was applauded for her understanding of the movement’s emphasis on naturalism; Maar also wrote poetry.</p>\n"

        "text": "<p>A critical figure in the development of modern art in postwar Latin America, Mathias Goeritz developed the principle of “emotional architecture.” The unique perspective considers spaces and objects that are produced to elicit empathy and celebrates collaboration rather than functionalism and individual authorship. After emigrating to Mexico from Spain in 1949, Goeritz opened the Museo Experimental El Eco. The institution served as the embodiment of these principles, facilitating collaboration and expanding upon existing notions of patronage. Best known for large-scale, totemic sculptures like <em>Moses and Heads</em>, Goeritz worked in a style that prefigured <a href=\"/gene/minimalism\">Minimalism</a> by 10 years. With its elongated, angular, rising and falling form, Goeritz’s sculpture <em>La Serpiente de El Eco</em> (The Serpent of the Echo) best embodies his artistic style.</p>\n"

Using primarily oil paint, watercolor, and—eventually—ink, Zao developed a unique style defined by contrasting colors, intense linework, and lyrical abstraction. Like traditional Chinese landscapes, Zao’s paintings function as fragments of larger scenes and possess a fluidity, transparency, and graceful luminosity that reflect the interior energies of the artist himself. Zao cited <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/paul-cezanne\">Paul Cézanne</a>, <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/henri-matisse\">Henri Matisse</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/pablo-picasso\">Pablo Picasso</a> as early influences. In 1948, he moved to Paris, where he immersed himself in the city’s avant-garde scene and befriended artists including <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/alberto-giacometti\">Alberto Giacometti</a>, <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/joan-miro\">Joan Miró</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/sam-francis\">Sam Francis</a>.

He drew widely from popular culture and everyday subject matter in his most famous works: his <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist-series/andy-warhol-campbells-soup-cans\">32 Campbell&#39;s soup cans</a>, <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist-series/andy-warhol-brillo-boxes\">Brillo pad box sculptures</a>, and portraits of <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist-series/andy-warhol-marilyn-monroe\">Marilyn Monroe</a> and Elizabeth Taylor, for example. Rejecting the dominant painting and sculpting modes of his day, Warhol embraced silk-screen printmaking to achieve his characteristic hard edges and flat areas of color. The artist mentored <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/keith-haring\">Keith Haring</a> and <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/jean-michel-basquiat\">Jean-Michel Basquiat</a> and continues to influence contemporary art around the world: His provocative successors include <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/richard-prince\">Richard Prince</a>, <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/takashi-murakami\">Takashi Murakami</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/jeff-koons\">Jeff Koons</a>.

McGlynn attended the Ontario College of Art and Design, however, he was not enrolled in the visual arts. McGlynn’s work contains reoccurring symbols such as animals from his upbringing, birds from his studio window sill and numbers that derive from when he memorized math tables in his early years. McGlynn’s work is as much about revealing the truth and expressing emotions as it is about documenting actual fact. His paintings reach into a wealth of historical influence and skill. Creating symphonic glyphs on rudimentary, raw quilt-like patterns, the works simultaneously evoke rural Southern quilts, early comic books, and Piet Mondrian.</p>\n<p>Since 1995, McGlynn has exhibited extensively in Canada, the United States and Europe. In 2005 Casey had a retrospective of his autobiographical work at the Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art in Colorado.</p>\n"

Her oeuvre is largely an exploration of the language of abstraction. She pairs wide and vigorous brushstrokes with fine line work: looping curves, areas of color saturation, and spaces of smoky evanescence. Like <a href=\"/artist/philip-guston\">Philip Guston</a>, Moser’s broader practice centers on a dialogue between painting and printmaking. “To work on a print is to strip down the constructive parts of an image, slowing down and revealing the performative aspects of its making,” she says. “I’m intrigued by how the process records both the structure and the event and makes the process become visible.” The print allows Moser to introduce a mechanical process that mediates between her hand and the image thereby allowing her to slow down and re-encounter her own gestures. </p>\n"

Her chosen surfaces range from canvases to pieces of cardboard and vintage Louis Vuitton suitcases. Rokkaku began painting in 2002 and her big break arrived in 2006, when she was awarded the prestigious Akio Goto Prize at Kaikai Kiki’s Geisai art fair. Since then, she has exhibited at galleries in Paris, Tokyo, and Amsterdam, and in 2015, she participated in the Swatch Art Pavilion’s Open Studio at the Venice Biennale. Her work regularly fetches six-figure prices on the secondary market. Rokkaku’s raucous compositions reflect her love for the unbounded freedom and energy of childhood.</p>\n"

The Brooklyn-based artist creates layered compositions based subject matter from her daily life: books, TV shows, dreams, and past experiences. She works by combining color, form, and pattern, both intuitively and intentionally, digging up sensations as intangible as the fist time she ever told a lie or the specific color of a beloved childhood bathing suit. “The paintings are like dreams,” Yazdan has said of her work. “The events of the day [are] reorganized and combined with other events and memories until a new, often surprising, reality has taken shape.”</p>\n"

Using paints and charcoal, the artist layers facial fragments, crude lines, and text slogans, which altogether suggest personality and narrative.

Born and raised in Essex, Preston Paperboy studied architecture before turning to fine art. He’s exhibited in London, Hong Kong, Atlanta, and Miami, among other cities. Through his work (which also includes sculpture), Preston Paperboy explores questions of love, loss, envy, and greed.</p>\n"

He has been making art since the 1960s, when he came on the scene as a young folk singer in Greenwich Village. Much of his work is generated out of his tours and reflects the impressions made upon him by the people and places he has encountered while bringing songs like “Blowin’ in the Wind” and “Subterranean Homesick Blues” to audiences everywhere. Dylan’s “Drawn Blank” series, produced between 1989 and 1992 while touring America, Europe, and Asia, forms a large part of his output. These expressionistic drawings, and the paintings born out of them, include street and interior scenes, landscapes, portraits, nudes, and still lifes—images as poetic and personal as his music.</p>\n"

        "text": "<p>Damien Hirst, a poster boy for the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/young-british-artists-ybas\">Young British Artists</a> who rose to prominence in late 1980s London, is one of the most notorious artists of his generation. He has pushed the limits of fine art and good taste with sculptures that comprise dead animals submerged in formaldehyde; innumerable spot paintings that appear mass-produced and can sell for millions of dollars; and the exuberantly tacky <em>For the Love of God</em> (2007), a human <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/collection/damien-hirst-skulls\">skull</a> studded with 8,601 diamonds. Through his installations, sculptures, drawings, and paintings, Hirst explores themes including religion, mortality, and desire. Since 1988, when the artist developed and curated “Freeze,” a groundbreaking exhibition of his work and that of his Goldsmiths College peers, he has been the subject of major shows at <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/tate\">Tate Modern</a> in London, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/ngadc\">National Gallery of Art</a> in Washington, D.C., and the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/rijksmuseum\">Rijksmuseum</a> in Amsterdam. In 2008, Hirst controversially staged “Beautiful Inside my Head Forever,” an auction in which he sold his work directly to the public and raked in around $200 million for himself. His individual works have sold for more than $10 million at auction.</p>\n"

In addition, his education at the Ecole Brassart in Tours afforded him the opportunity to study the drawings and paintings of old and new masters.</p>\n<p>He cites inspiration from artists like Rembrandt for showing us the soul of his sitters, Van Dyke for his elegance, Bonnard’s palette, Fuchs for the fantastic world he invented; all of which influence his style today.</p>\n<p>He has stated, “Art is something you cultivate; it is alive! My joy of painting is to listen to the piece and to have a discussion with it. Each one has its own personality”.</p>\n<p>Fressinier’s process for painting involves a bit of sketching, however; he takes greater pleasure in being alone in his studio, letting his paintings speak to him and watching them appear progressively and without force. He continues to be moved by the work of other artists, frequently visiting museums and galleries and art libraries to expand his imagination. He is passionate about painting, and also enjoys spending time with his two children, gardening, reading, and playing guitar. He credits his wife, Colette, with being his muse and considers his faith in God central to his being.</p>\n<p>Fressinier’s paintings have been exhibited and collected throughout the United States and internationally.</p>\n"

Bambi, also dubbed “The Female Banksy,” creates stenciled works which are frequently described as gritty and masculine in appearance even if she is exploring themes of feminism, popular and street culture, while using  incorporating spray painting techniques with unique mediums such as diamond dust and gold leaf. While her identity remains a well-kept secret, the artist has revealed that she had a prominent career in the music business as popular singer. —<em>Courtesy of Fine Art Auctions Miami</em></p>\n"

        "text": "<p>Widely considered one of the leading <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/surrealism\">Surrealists</a> (though he was never officially part of the group), Joan Miró was also a pioneer of <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/automatism\">automatism</a>: a method of spontaneous drawing that attempted to express the inner workings of the human psyche. Miró used color and form in a symbolic manner, developing intricate compositions and a wandering linear style that combined abstract elements with recurring motifs such as birds, eyes, and the moon. During his lifetime, Miró received the Grand Prize for Graphic Work at the 1954 Venice Biennale, exhibited at the first Documenta exhibition in 1955, and enjoyed multiple high-profile retrospectives. Today, Miró’s work—which has sold for eight figures at auction—can be found in the permanent collections of the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artic\">Art Institute of Chicago</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/museum-of-modern-art\">Museum of Modern Art</a>, among other institutions. His public sculptures and murals are installed in cities around the world, including Milan, Paris, and Barcelona. </p>\n"

The Brooklyn-based artist creates layered compositions based subject matter from her daily life: books, TV shows, dreams, and past experiences. She works by combining color, form, and pattern, both intuitively and intentionally, digging up sensations as intangible as the fist time she ever told a lie or the specific color of a beloved childhood bathing suit. “The paintings are like dreams,” Yazdan has said of her work. “The events of the day [are] reorganized and combined with other events and memories until a new, often surprising, reality has taken shape.”</p>\n"

They often feature enigmatic, confrontational found phrases or illegible scribbles, which are either stencilled or plastered in black across flat white fields. The artist occasionally covers the compositions with spray-paint marks and screen-printed elements (some taken from his previous works), erasing and relayering as he goes. His process—which focuses on the possibilities of reproduction, appropriation, and accretion—is as important as the results themselves. Wool studied at Sarah Lawrence College and the New York Studio School. New York’s vibrant 1970s downtown No Wave and punk scenes became major influences, and Wool reached his mature style in the mid-1980s. Wool has exhibited in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, London, Paris, Tokyo, Berlin, and beyond, and his work belongs in the collections of the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/museum-of-modern-art\">Museum of Modern Art</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/centrepompidou\">Centre Pompidou</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/tate\">Tate</a>.

Today, his work sells for five figures on the secondary market and can be found in the collections of the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/whitneymuseum\">Whitney Museum of American Art</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/guggenheim\">Guggenheim Museum</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/metmuseum\">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>, the Bahrain National Museum, and the Guilin Art Museum, among other institutions. Slonem also paints portraits, particularly of Abraham Lincoln, and creates prints and sculptures. </p>\n"

Since founding their eponymous studio in 2010, the duo has exhibited in New York, Miami, Los Angeles, Zürich, Venice, and Tokyo, among other cities, and their work has been acquired by the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/los-angeles-county-museum-of-art\">Los Angeles County Museum of Art</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/the-metropolitan-museum-of-art\">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/cooper-hewitt-smithsonian-design-museum\">Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum</a>. The Haas Brothers have also published a children’s book and collaborated with Lady Gaga, Rihanna, and Versace. Their work has sold for six figures at auction.</p>\n"

        "text": "<p>Born in Cognac, France in 1968 to scholarly portrait photographer parents with an affinity for aesthetics, it was fitting that modern figurative artist, François Fressinier, would develop a unique, enchanting style.</p>\n<p>His father’s admiration for the works of the Old Masters and his exposure to some of the world’s most historic places, along with France’s Gallo-Roman ruins and Gothic churches inclined François to explore and create figurative, symbolic artwork. In addition, his education at the Ecole Brassart in Tours afforded him the opportunity to study the drawings and paintings of old and new masters.</p>\n<p>He cites inspiration from artists like Rembrandt for showing us the soul of his sitters, Van Dyke for his elegance, Bonnard’s palette, Fuchs for the fantastic world he invented; all of which influence his style today.</p>\n<p>He has stated, “Art is something you cultivate; it is alive! My joy of painting is to listen to the piece and to have a discussion with it. Each one has its own personality”.</p>\n<p>Fressinier’s process for painting involves a bit of sketching, however; he takes greater pleasure in being alone in his studio, letting his paintings speak to him and watching them appear progressively and without force. He continues to be moved by the work of other artists, frequently visiting museums and galleries and art libraries to expand his imagination. He is passionate about painting, and also enjoys spending time with his two children, gardening, reading, and playing guitar. He credits his wife, Colette, with being his muse and considers his faith in God central to his being.</p>\n<p>Fressinier’s paintings have been exhibited and collected throughout the United States and internationally.</p>\n"

        "text": "<p>Pius Fox’s paintings and works on paper are determined by two main factors: elementary compositions and colour, which he applies to emphasize features, reinforce borders and to link superimposed layers together. Though defined by simplicity, many works reveal a great freedom, deliberately switching between abstract and figurative, between monochrome and colourful. Often minimalistic in their design featuring geometric shapes, originally deriving from features of his studio interior like door frames, curtains and windows, the works have recently become more complex and symbolically charged through poetic titles. </p>\n<p>His small format compositions of only few lines, basic grids and simple shapes remind us of the paintings of Raoul de Keyser or the abstract works of Richard Diebenkorn, though they greatly differ in the treatment of the surface. Fox likes to divide the image and not to treat the image area as a whole. He intersects his compositions by inserting horizontal, vertical and even diagonal lines and inserts painted or drawn frames surrounding a main part of his works. The spectator journeys through his oeuvre as if through a labyrinth, digging into depth to uncover what cannot be fully grasped at first sight. </p>\n<p>Fox is a painter who appreciates traditional materials like oil on canvas or paper as well as watercolour, but for inspiration he also experiments with other media like drawing, photography and printing. Whichever medium he decides for, colour plays a central role and is often a starting point for the pictorial content. Fox thereby reverts to secondary and tertiary colors, frequently coloured grey tones: antique pink, grey-green, a blue or purple black. In addition, the works show a strong spatial quality, as Fox plays with different layers, overpaints elements or scratches on the surface to reveal the layer beneath. </p>\n"

        "text": "<p>Using <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/humor\">humor</a> and over-the-top sensuality, Angela Dufresne creates <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/narrative\">narrative</a> <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/painting\">paintings</a> that depict absurdist allegories of perversion and debauchery. Dufrense received her MFA from the Tyler School of Art in Philadelphia in 1998, and she was awarded a Guggenheim fellowship in 2016. Her work has been exhibited at <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/moma-ps1\">MoMA PS1</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/hammer-museum\">Hammer Museum</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/partner/the-aldrich-contemporary-art-museum\">Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum</a>. At once recalling history painting, Italian <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/futurism\">Futurism</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/abstract-expressionism\">Abstract Expressionism</a>, Dufresne’s paintings skillfully merge abstract and figurative elements by layering transparent and outlined forms atop fluid, gestural backgrounds. Her loose brushwork lends her canvases a montage-like sense of movement and a chaotic beauty. Borrowing imagery from mythology, film, art history, and <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/popular-culture\">pop culture</a>, she creates fantastical tableaux populated by queer lovers, hybrid beasts, and film stars. Amalgams of aesthetic and historical references, Dufresne’s paintings engage with histories of visual storytelling and cultural production as well as contemporary queer and <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/contemporary-feminist\">feminist</a> discourses.</p>\n"

His artmaking soon expanded beyond these movements as the artist explored how different media could interact. Tuttle’s “Wire” pieces comprise a line drawn on a wall, a wire, and a shadow; altogether they form a three-dimensional work. His “Constructed” paintings are assemblages that bridge the gap between canvas and sculpture. Much of Tuttle’s work makes use of wood, tin, wire, tape, balloons, and other features that extend beyond traditional frames. Tuttle has exhibited in New York, London, Paris, Zürich, Berlin, Tokyo, and Milan.

Flore embodies &#39;the spirit of Keith Haring&#39; and is closely influenced by artists such as Jean Michel Basquiat and George Condo. His work ranges from contemporary art pieces to mid-century modern inspired interior design.</p>\n<p>Having exhibited all over the world, Flore began 2018 with the debut of his first solo show in Los Angeles &#39; A Perpetual Compulsive Repetition of Words&#39;. Through this exhibition, Flore invited collectors on a voyeuristic journey into his headspace over the past year.</p>\n<p>Intentionally choosing words that leave room for multiple interpretations, Flore creates space for his viewers to develop their own narratives alongside evoking introspective emotive moments. While exploring those motifs, he platforms his deep influence from the late Keith Haring through graphic and text-heavy pieces that interpret the myriad experiences and nuances of the world. The show will further delve into his artistry while in tandem deconstructing the way we grow up in America — a concept birthed from being creatively triggered by music, conversation and philosopher Alan Watts.</p>\n"

She conveys the magnitude of the environment through depictions of evening skies and dense forests. In some works, Smith homes in on specific details such as plant bark, rippling water, and fallen leaves. The artist approaches landscape painting with the reverence of a portraitist, isolating tree trunks and wasp nests to highlight their unique forms and textures. By employing a primarily black-and-white palette, Smith communicates the eternal quality of nature while also alluding to its fragility. </p>\n"

He has pushed the limits of fine art and good taste with sculptures that comprise dead animals submerged in formaldehyde; innumerable spot paintings that appear mass-produced and can sell for millions of dollars; and the exuberantly tacky <em>For the Love of God</em> (2007), a human <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/collection/damien-hirst-skulls\">skull</a> studded with 8,601 diamonds. Through his installations, sculptures, drawings, and paintings, Hirst explores themes including religion, mortality, and desire. Since 1988, when the artist developed and curated “Freeze,” a groundbreaking exhibition of his work and that of his Goldsmiths College peers, he has been the subject of major shows at <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/tate\">Tate Modern</a> in London, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/ngadc\">National Gallery of Art</a> in Washington, D.C., and the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/rijksmuseum\">Rijksmuseum</a> in Amsterdam.

        "text": "<p>Francisco Valverde (1972) lives and works in Mexico City.  </p>\n<p>Valverde was teaching traditional techniques and large-format painting at Morelense Center for the Arts (Centro Morelense de las Artes) when he was inspired by his students’ search for their individual expression, which leads to his own quest in his artistic practice. He then began working on large scale works using bottle dispensers filled with colorful synthetic materials instead of traditional paints and brushes. His goal was to re-create the essential element within drawing and painting: the line. The resulting lines were imperfect and denied the traditional representative characteristic of a line, or what Francisco describes as “righteousness.” These paintings form a rhythmic structure in which a certain order persists. Valverde’s pigmented resin works are comprised of powerful lines with direction, mysterious forms, and varying depths to create a story. Obsession and freedom are two words that Valverde uses to describe his current work: the obsession of daily routine, and the freedom of experimenting as a child drawing and scribbling on a piece of paper for the very first time. He recognizes that a certain commitment to tradition survives in the smooth finishes of his paintings. </p>\n<p>Francisco Valverde obtained a BA in Fine Arts at the University Art Center College of Design in California. He has participated in numerous international solo and group exhibitions and has been included in the 2004 and 2016 Rufino Tamayo Biennial at the Contemporary Museum Rufino Tamayo (Mexico City). &quot;(IN)organicus&quot; will be his first exhibition in Canada.</p>\n"

        "text": "<p>Julian Opie’s simple, graphic figurative portraits and landscapes generate a pared-back perspective on contemporary life. The artist’s distinctive, thickly outlined silhouettes take inspiration from classical portraiture, Japanese woodblock prints, Egyptian hieroglyphics, and traffic signs. Opie studied at Goldsmiths’ College and has exhibited in London, Tokyo, New York, Los Angeles, Berlin, Seoul, and many other cities. His work belongs in the collections of England’s Arts Council, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/ica-boston\">Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/museum-of-modern-art\">Museum of Modern Art</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/stedelijk-museum\">Stedelijk Museum</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/national-portrait-gallery-london\">National Portrait Gallery</a> in London, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/the-national-museum-of-modern-art-tokyo\">National Museum of Modern Art</a> in Tokyo, and many others. His pieces have fetched six-figure prices on the secondary market. Opie’s practice spans painting, drawing, sculpture, and film.</p>\n"

        "text": "<p>Painter Victor Castillo has been identified as a pop-surrealist for his distinguishable stylistic references to vintage comics, animation, and popular media. After experiencing disillusionment with his native Chile and studies in art school, Castillo developed his current style out of “frustration and anger,” and a dark sense of humor. His works spin ominous allegorical and political narratives of current world crises in post-apocalyptic settings; greed, chaos, brutality and destruction are frequent themes in his work. The protagonists of his paintings are frequently children with blank eyes—the artist’s metaphor for ignorance. Castillo admits that people might find his works “a little tenebrous or even satanic,” but explains that he is not a dark person, and is instead interested in creating accessible art. His work is also influenced by Spanish Old Master painters, particularly <a href=\"/artist/francisco-de-goya\">Francisco de Goya</a>.</p>\n"
