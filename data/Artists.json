The Brooklyn-based artist creates layered compositions based subject matter from her daily life: books, TV shows, dreams, and past experiences. She works by combining color, form, and pattern, both intuitively and intentionally, digging up sensations as intangible as the fist time she ever told a lie or the specific color of a beloved childhood bathing suit. “The paintings are like dreams,” Yazdan has said of her work. “The events of the day [are] reorganized and combined with other events and memories until a new, often surprising, reality has taken shape.”</p>\n"

They add a modern finish to their works with vibrant bursts of colorful spray paint and lettering inspired by graffiti pioneers like Dondi and Crash.

Notable past projects include the Houston Bowery Wall in New York City and an 85-foot high sculpture for the Fallas Festival in their native Valencia, Spain.

Many of their pieces orbit around common themes of contemporary culture, politics, mass media, and consumerism, and frequently borrow images or motifs from these sources. The two artists are perhaps best known for large-scale installations that act as interventions within their surroundings, or pieces that are humorously though provocatively political. “We&#39;re being referred to as project artists now,” Borins has said. “And we’re thinking of ourselves, more and more, as activists.” </p>\n"

He has pushed the limits of fine art and good taste with sculptures that comprise dead animals submerged in formaldehyde; innumerable spot paintings that appear mass-produced and can sell for millions of dollars; and the exuberantly tacky <em>For the Love of God</em> (2007), a human <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/collection/damien-hirst-skulls\">skull</a> studded with 8,601 diamonds. Through his installations, sculptures, drawings, and paintings, Hirst explores themes including religion, mortality, and desire.

In 2008, Hirst controversially staged “Beautiful Inside my Head Forever,” an auction in which he sold his work directly to the public and raked in around $200 million for himself.

As with all his installations, Quinze intends to provoke reactions from passersby, in this case inviting the viewers to reflect on “how people conduct their lives, live around each other, and order society,” as he describes.

        "text": "<p>Leonor Fini’s mid-century paintings feature dreamlike scenes in which dominant women and passive men undercut traditional notions of sex and gender. Nude or heavily costumed, Fini’s characters embrace humor, eroticism, and mythological symbolism. The Argentine-born, Italian-raised artist was a friend and contemporary of key members of the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/surrealism\">Surrealist</a> movement and featured in the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/museum-of-modern-art\">Museum of Modern Art</a>’s groundbreaking “Fantastic Art, Dada and Surrealism” exhibition in 1936. While her works embrace strangeness and the uncanny, Fini refused to label herself a Surrealist due to the group’s misogynist element. Her work has been exhibited in New York, Rome, Paris, and London, and she participated in the Venice Biennale and São Paulo Biennial on multiple occasions. Today, her work sells for six figures on the secondary market and belongs to the permanent collections of the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/metmuseum\">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>, <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/tate\">Tate Modern</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/centrepompidou\">Centre Georges Pompidou</a>, among other institutions. Along with her maximalist paintings, Fini is also known for her delicate drawings.</p>\n"

After covering her canvases with bold, gestural brushstrokes, she adds layers of graffiti-style text—the words “I love you” are a frequent motif—and familiar shapes such as hearts, flowers, and Pac-Man ghosts. Goldhammer aims to convey a message of love and hope. Her work has been exhibited in New York, Dallas, Toronto, Hong Kong, and Zürich, among other cities, and appeared in such TV series as <em>Being Mary Jane</em>, <em>Scandal</em>, and <em>Silicon Valley</em>. In 2020, Goldhammer collaborated with Isabel Marant on the French designer’s spring/summer 2021 collection. </p>\n"
