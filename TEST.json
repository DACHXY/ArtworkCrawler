            "additionalInformation": "<p>Ekaterina Ermilkina’s original, abstract fine art paintings are created using a skillful combination of applying and removing oil paint with a palette knife on canvas. Her inspirations are the expressionistic skylines of big cities like Manhattan, Philadelphia, or Chicago filled with colorful skyscrapers. The urban, scenic views are abstracted and rich with vivid and textured layers. Ermilkina’s emotional architectural patchwork and mosaic cityscapes radiate a life of balance and positive energy.</p>\n<p>This artwork measures 20 inches high by 60 inches wide. Ermilkina carefully adds thick cube-like dots of oil paint with a palette knife in distinct patterns onto the surface, adding an intricate three-dimensional texture to her oil paintings. The color spots partially blend into a fuller range of background tones and give the artworks a significant depth. She signs the front of the artwork and paints the sides as a continuation of the front. It does not require framing. It is wired and ready to hang. Free local Los Angeles area delivery. Affordable U.S. and global shipping available. A certificate of authenticity issued by the gallery is included. This artwork is exhibited at Artspace Warehouse, one of the leading international art galleries in Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>Born in 1975, Saratov, Russia, Ekaterina Ermilkina now lives and works in New Jersey. She grew up in the beautiful city of Yalta in Crimea on the North coast of the Black Sea, where in 1985 she enrolled as a student to the School of Art of F.Vasiliev, graduating in 1991.</p>\n<p>After her first introduction to fine art in Yalta, in 1992, Ekaterina Ermilkina moved to Saint-Petersburg, Russia. In 1998 she received her MFA from State Art and Industry Academy. The unique beauty and rich culture of the city inspired her to paint cityscapes.</p>\n<p>In late 2005, Ermilkina moved to the U.S. Her works has been presented in various solo and group exhibitions in international galleries and art fairs and have been collected throughout the United States, as well as Canada, Germany, France, Switzerland, Japan, Hong Kong, and Russia.</p>\n<p>Her artworks pop with color and motion, casting a candied haze across the urban landscape. “I am focused on art all my life. It makes me optimistic, full of energy and happy. The vivid colors of Crimea where I grew up, the beautiful marine of the Black Sea, inspired me to paint for the rest of my life. I believe that paintings can reflect our desires for beauty, poetics and perfection.”</p>\n<p>Exhibitions<br>2021 Affordable Art Fair New York<br>Port Authority Bus Terminal, New York, NY<br>“The Real Presence”, Artspace Warehouse, Los Angeles, CA<br>2020 High Point Market, North Carolina<br>Hamptons Virtual Art Fair<br>Six Summit Gallery, Westbrook CT<br>2019 Affordable Art Fair New York, NY<br>Artspace Warehouse, Los Angeles, CA<br>Leo House, Chelsea, New York City, NY<br>David Parker Gallery, New York City, NY<br>High Point Market, NC<br>2018 Affordable Art Fair, Hong Kong<br>2018 Artspace Warehouse Gallery, Los Angeles<br>2018 Gallery 104, New York, NY<br>2018 Discovery in the Details, SMI, Montclair NJ<br>2018 Windows, SMI New Jersey<br>2018 State of the Art, Montclair NJ<br>2017 Affordable Art Fair New York, NY<br>2017 Kölner Liste Contemporary Art Fair, Köln, Germany<br>2017 New York Fashion Week, NY<br>2016 Affordable Art Fair, Amsterdam<br>2016 Affordable Art Fair Hong Kong<br>2016 AAF New York, NY<br>2016 Kunstwarenhaus Zurich, Switzerland<br>2016 ART &amp; LEF Gallery, Groningen, Netherlands<br>2016 Love Park, Philadelphia, PA<br>2016 Bluestone Fine Art Gallery, Philadelphia, PA<br>2016 Artspace Warehouse, Los Angeles, CA<br>2016 Art Leaders Gallery, MI<br>2015 Affordable Art Fair Singapore<br>2015 Artspace Warehouse Los Angeles, CA<br>2015 Bluestone Fine Art Gallery, Philadelphia, PA<br>2015 Art Leaders Gallery, MI<br>2015 Art Design Consultants Gallery, Cincinnati, OH<br>2015 Dorma Design Center New York City, NY<br>2015 Main Line Art Center, Haverford, PA<br>2015 Love Art Fair Toronto, Canada<br>2015 Affordable Art Fair New York, NY<br>2015 Berkshire Real Estate Art Gallery, Livingston, NJ<br>2015 ACL Gallery, Livingston NJ<br>2014 Bluestone Fine Art Gallery, Philadelphia, PA<br>2014 The Barn Theatre, Montville, NJ<br>2014 Spectrum Art Fair, Miami, FL<br>2014 Artspace Warehouse, Los Angeles, CA<br>2013 Bluestone Fine Art Gallery, Philadelphia, PA<br>2013 Saatchi Screen Project, London, UK<br>2012 Artexpo, New York, NY<br>2012 Paintbox Soho Gallery, New York, NY<br>2012 The Barn Theatre, Montville, NJ<br>2011 Studio Montclair Block Gallery, Montclair, NJ<br>2011 Summer Salon 13th Anniversary, Montclair, NJ<br>2010 Chekhov House &amp; Museum, Yalta, Ukraine<br>2006 Fine Arts Society of the Southern Tier, Binghamton, NY</p>\n<p>Representations<br>Artspace Warehouse Los Angeles, CA<br>Bluestone, Philadelphia, PA</p>\n<p>Publications<br>2012 Art for the People: A Collector&#39;s Journal by Michael Corbin<br>2012 New Art International.
